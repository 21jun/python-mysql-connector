this is satisfying cann someone tell me if this game is turn based like age of the empires 1145 because the video is sponsored he cant make funny of bugs its free from 1211 to 18 on epic and that is pretty much the reason why i will not get it even toug it looks nice and raptor manages it to make it look even more interesting i would have bought it gold or whatever on steams but i do really not need another vendor besides valve and ea also the greedmove to pull it of steam after it was listet and move it epic exclusive kinda annoys me its free on epic store now how big is the file size is this game fun i sure miss them empires dawn of the modern age battles epic micro management now you can buy this game in amazon httpsamznto2q0xayu looks alot like age of empires worth a shot for sure coming back to rewatch this and i just notice the date of the uploaded video april 122019april 12th hmmmmmmm i cant see a diference with anno 1404 better graphics some different buildings but whole game mechanism is just same even a map size is still same small is there anything new compared to 1404 id love to play it but omg the game is massively overpriced on uplay gosh i see a lot of cities skylines borrowings when and where can i buy this in australia im always amazed when someone makes a game in 2019 that looks like its from 2009 i love how you pronounce ubisoft you are talking like a real capitalist is there any train in this anno or how is it compared to anno 1404 ubisoft sucks for screwing fans for anno 2070 my ocd really dislikes the way you organize your buildings and roads how good does your laptop have to be to run anna 1800 on high and low lol he used one of my usernames on origin there is a story behind that name of mine though hi im new here zwollen is a city in the netherlands how do you fertilizer your hop fields just subbed love this video and getting the game later this week great work mate age of empires iii still my favourite game i love this game but i cant afford to buy because very expensive i dont have money yo buy this game lets start our sausage trade thats right i thought i can buy it on steam ted mosby is that you is this online game i mean other islands are real players can i play as indian to destroy british empire and bring them to their knees for what they did to the world if youre new here say hey well hey god damn it now i really need to build a gaming pc havent gamed in over 7 years and this is one reason to start casual gaming again hi down below in the comments section similar with skyline city which one is newer and which one you guys like best age of empire the best strategy game thumbs up if agree ahahso it is basically same gameplay like zeus master of olympus and pharaoh i played 15 years agonice love the music this is such a great video man ive loved the anno series since 1604 ive been putting of downloading this game because it consumes my life once i start but damn i gotta play this myself thanks for the great reviewgameplay demo and to ubisoft developers for kicking ass woah man how come i never found this earlier in my childhood i can also influence the news that is like real life so goddamn amazing 9 year olds when you said wood and bricks and steel fortnite i feel low fps in this d d is this game very demanding on gpu is it ooobesoft or youbesoft i always pronounced it the second way lol villages at 2300 they ninjad it from ceasar iii haha i will not be playing this as i feel it has missed a golden opportunity for men with muskets and cavalry etc i am not all about war i love to be immersed in this games art and animations and usually have to mod it so i can zoom in further to see the beautiful details most people ignore like in 1400 but yea what a missed opportunity my game crashing dont drop the sope thing to good game and gameplay dont buy any game from ubisoft i warned you they will cgarge your card and not give you the game if you make a support ticket it will take 39 days to get a standard reply that they will investigate the problem if you look on internet yes i was stupid enough to do it before i bought it you see the problem is there for years why do you think they cancel the steam launch because they would get tons of negative reviews i do not say the games are bad just the platform the support and everything with ubisoft in the name is just pure horror settlers on steroids i tried anno 1404 once turned out to be the worst game ever made theres like a million tiny buttons all over the screen and a million ways to micromanage everything but every button is explained only once when a small tipwindow pops open so obviously its impossible to memorize eventually i figured out most of it but after an hour of playing i just couldnt figure out how to set up any trade deals i knew how to buy things from the ais but no way to exchange or sell anything also it took like 20 minutes just to figure out how to get things off the ship i was also unable to figure out how to order people to get on the ship or how to put items into the safe so i just got frustrated and uninstalled the game so basically it looks interesting to play but one needs to get like a game developer to personally tutor you to figure out how to actually play your voice is so soothing i just woke up and youre putting me back to sleep men nice ingame episode didnt even know that anno after all these years was still going strong last time i played was 1503 and of course the very first one before that 1602 if they release an mac os version i will try it edit ill just boot camp my imac this is caesar upgrade please anno 2000 seems like you started in the netherlands zwollen is a dutch city love this series and this one continues to innovateso fun thank you httpsstoreepicgamescomfallenanno1800 play it its actually fun i wish i wasnt poor or i would buy this watching play this game is opening up to me to get this game never played a game like this before seems a little difficult what do they grow on the potato farm consoles how about the chinese women character they should have an annon 1901 new york city the graphics and the buildings in this game is beautifully made very high quality i wish city skylines had such graphics and such assets but if so it could require very very highend pcs to run if this game was not gridbased but allowing players to build roads freely this could be cities 1800 the name of the island has something in common with my balls they are both zwollen thats horrible i hate old stuff i rather play anno 2205 which is futuristic i feel more at home there love this series this is my second time through probably watch again till i can afford the game i would get the game but my pc cant run it so im watching videos to satisfy my urge to build xd can you play without ships why does the open beta end two days before launch how could the developers implement changes in two days they cant is it possible to have combat in this game i hated 5915 fake news media like how do people pla this game like wtf oo boring look like a cool game altougth what really annoy me now about city building game is own everything need to be in a square i wish that would lower the city attractivness no steam download i was really waiting for this game thats unfortunate wish it came on mac hey mate found your vids looking for anno 1800 content by far my fav content creator so far for this game loved when you said zwollen i live in zwolle in the netherlands ive also seen a version of the dutch town groningen inspired perhaps its look like a more realistic tropico how did you know my password o dino mann is it weird to not really like the game type but just the sense of progress just satisfies me plus this dude got a nice voice so i dont mind it but wheres the corruption at this is nothing like rl see my newest video if you would like this game for free and you can thank me later see my newest video if you would like this game for free and you can thank me later hello which platform do you play this on dude build your lumber mills close to your log cutters that way you dont have to transport the logs from cutters to warehouse they just go straight to the lumber mill without the need of connecting roads please consider having more comercials i like your tv like approach the most important resource in this game is potatoes 144 shouldve gone with the fleur de lis and the purple it wouldve made some people laugh beach side property would have been fun in reality the people would rather live near beaches parks beautiful landscapes the game should calculate for that instead of pushing for efficiency of production resource extraction 1013 us oil invades immediately full output storage means your warehouse is full to capacity upgrading your warehouse just lets more goods be loaded at a time the depot creates more capacity congrats on the sponsorship man i really want this gamebut gotta stick to 1404 because of my potato pc not blaming him but it kind of burdens me that he calls anno 1800 as einno 1800 this is my first time watching a gameplay in anno series is it like tropico love from philippines the layout you build in is so americanised lmao everything is so far away and spread out wait is this a new anno game what anno 2205 should have been smh i hope u do not destroy this series like u did in raptoria by progressing in a livestream which we never able to find in recording awesome explanation i have used other anno programs and have got so frustrated by not knowing the importance of various skills and buildings thank you not on macos please do more anno 1800 content or a series on it 3 love ur content liked for sponsorship hi im new here basically watching this because the few reviews on anno 1800 arent good better than banished anno or ano means butthole in my country thats probably the only reason i wouldnt try this game hey im new like a subscribed raptor for shame you should have called yourself dino might much more manly and corny edit 1 also does a higher quality road increase warehouse range edit 2 i think the warehouse thing is a backup in production or holding not a lack of access to warehouses if i enjoy age of empires will i enjoy this or is it more like civ or something else i dont enjoy is this game on ps4 5300 dont drop the soap that kind of thing better than tropico hey imma be honest im never fucking comment but man did ur friendly voice just convinced me to say hi in the comments you can go in first person by doing control shift r i have played age of empires roller coaster tycoon warcraft and never have i heard of anno this is something that is preordered on the last day for it to be on steam looking forward to it i love how video game makers use video game sto try and change the past the indian trading company was english not from persia 4308 damn man thats a huge mistake might have to unsub hi new here looking forward to your review upon release it is going to be so taxing on your system i played open beta and when the city is too big it lags a lot such a beautiful game but the straight roads are so wrong i know grids are efficient but they look gross the blue icons above buildings isnt that there arent enough workers its because your storages and also the buildings are full and they have no where to take it this is the one thing i dont like about this game is the universal storage system you can have 100 storage buildings yet it holds the same principle amount it should have carts having to move the items you want where you need them not just load 1 warehouse and its available all over an island they developed this stupid system where buildings have to be in range of warehouses yet they are magically available anywhere and ofc the same thing works for the population they can live across one side of an island but amazingly work on the other side even if there are no roads to their house this game is not as functional as it should be its more eye candy you can see this easily that your whole city is very active yet you have no ppl or very little available for jobs in which that is supposed to be where they are at the never play this game title before was i the only person getting annoyed that he placed factories right next to the farms one optimization tip create a city for things that are less appealing for example animal pastures and save your main city for the more luxurious goods 4307 that right there is where the war was lost love your content but yikes at all the ads in this video i dont care what anyone says i still say ubisoft and not ubisoft is jeff goldblumnarrating this its painfull to see you do this as a job and you cant figure out a good grid with the housing etc i used to be an explorer but i have a zwollen knee now i bought on steam this game because of u raptoria i love you no homo from india thanks for making me happy if your gaming vids and lovely personality we cant upgrade artisans on open beta if i buy on steam now will i get updates dlc etc in future 4311 what a huge mistake i cant believe what i just saw this is 5999 are you gonna be making this a series i would love to see that i watched another youtuber play anno 1800 and she pointed out that the numbers in the name of all the anno games add up to the number 9 eg 18009 purpletor could be the new island i dont care if it is a sponsored video just give me moar anno theres the raptor way then theres the gray way would be good if they change the upgrades so you dont have to do every building one by one and icons over buildings to make it easier to find specific types ie the union building when they all look kinda similar been playing it all day looks like the one i bought like 6 years ago this is just quality youtube gaming really enjoy watching your anno 1800 videos youve sold me on buying it for sure i love this its like an upgrade of dawn of mancivage of empires all in one so cool thanks raptor i was going to be pissed that it was going to epic but then i realized its an ubisoft game and steam was only going to be a middleman for uplay anyways i was bummed that i wont be able to get it on pc but at least raptor is here to bring the fun thanks man this game is great episode 2 will be great too not on steam no interest does it have microtransactions thats my only concern otherwise it looks great i am is your anno fans seriously though is it oobisoft or yoobisoft name a ship hail the general its the name of my retired racehorse he was whats called a warhorse 50 races on his career great name for a warship my man wanna play this game so bad when it releases but sadly not available for mac or on xbox pleaaasssseeee make a video every day i missed your videos of anno 1800 it is anno 1800 and i am get it ps like the i did it best series going finally back game looks good hope to see you play more of it ubisoft thank you for creating a game with epic music we should call it pangea my favourite anno games are 1404 2205 2070 1800 can you pause anno make all your trade routes building orders etc then resume or can you only issue commands and execute actions while the game is running live plus consider the layouts of your production chains proper placement drives up efficiently and heres the prison where all the good people are lol keep it up man like the anno saga haha name the ship just sponsor so you can call it the sponsor ship finally another anno 1800 video please play it more when it releases love it great vid why only have one port per island never mind figured out how to download it awesome cant wait to play are engineers finally here when you raptor found carl leonard von malching i immediately started to hate him for no other reason that he acts like a pompous ahole you need to take him down first when the time is ready more tropico 6 with the modern times please i was looking forward to buying this game but now they are taking it out of the steam store i wont bother a shame really because i was looking so much to playing this i is a happ boi love to see you play anno best youtube channel ever more good to see you uncle raptor idk if you know this the upgraded road increases the service area of the buildings like pub and market love the anno series man thank you as i watch this i have the open beta downloading yes the perfect combo is here again raptor and anno1800 comes to gives us joy remember to tumb up guess what i named my city raptoria suckas finally an anno episode the eastern front is great and all but i like anno better nuthole wonder if the open beta lets you have access to engineers yay raptor this is my favorite series i already have a ship name punisher you have the werst axint woman keen as a threeleg goat keralis amazing he is so enthusiastic i love this rewatching this series just because i like the smell of you the way you grid out and construct everything is so satisfying to watch especially when you planted those sheep farms and they fitted so perfectly with those roads i swear my whole lifes stress level went away having just finished watching your series of videos on anno 2205 i was thrilled to see you were posting a playthrough of anno 1800 influenced by your videos i am downloading anno 1800 as i type this comment what is your seed please my 1404 cheat to create superships does not work bummer after playing banish i couldnt love anything else i just bought tropico 6 beacuse of you with my under 0 back account yikes just seen the price of this 50 what wait gonna pass and put another 800 hours into factorio i think please play more tropico hey keralis does this game requires an internet connection just loved the video you just cant find a more relaxing place on the internet than a keralis anno series perfect to escape all the stress of life i like your deep voice its like im listening to a radio program lol trade for cattles and seed crops like in banished would be great keralis here is a code it has nothing to do with the game 1404 you are like the bob ross of gaming this game keeps crashing since it came out anno 1800 sucks dick if you cant play it jeez laweeez fix it i didnt pay for a crashing game what a shame what is the download size after i buy this i know it says 60gig is the download that damn big this is entertaining however for future lets play i like to see more min max and strategies and tactics for efficiency thanks is it worth it i miss the mine craft lets build episodes open beta full game for 3 days and then release less than a week later that isnt a beta that is a prerelease a beta is to work out balance concept and bugs if you release it less than a week before launch you wont fix anything until after the launch wish i had the money to buy it ayayayyy karambait so amazing to watch again endeavor just relax and enjoy hey keralis your rememeber or happend to record what seed you used to generate the map would love to use your island so perfect alright m8 a few episodes are out so im gonna grab me some popcorn coz its time to binge it the game is great but i just love watchinglistening to you while you play it for some reason haha d you convinced me to buy this game been following anno 1800s series since the beta stage and i absolutely love the way you play the game so relaxing they really hit my itch with this one i love that they were bright enough to sponsor you as well it seems weird to me that they put so much care into the character animations but when you build things the game just plops the edifices down out of thin air rather than showing your citizens doing the construction that irks me for some reason though it doesnt look like ill be buying this one anyway since apparently its not on steam if anno looks so amazing imagine how new cities skylines will look wow hating on florida lol what are you playing this on its like you can see the grid before the grid i just happen to meet your channel love the way you play and your voice is so calm and beautiful gonna binge every video i hate this voice if theres a better youtuber for citybuilding games i dont want to know great series keralis i assume this is the sandbox version of the game you are playing i always start of anxious during a keralis video but that voice fixes everything your voice so sweet omg the render is so fast owo anno is best game ever 3 it is beautiful hi keralis new to this type of game thanks for the videos love them do you remap your keyboard so that use wsad since im on the computer its hard not to use those keys if you do which functions to you assign to wsad man you build the place quickly my fav chanel about city building game yaaay keralis hey keralis i would love to see you playing anno1800 with some old friends of yours we know from older lets plays in the multiplayer mode can you please post seed of the island looks really nice im so glad this game has come out so i can watch keralis play but where is tropico 6 if someone hasnt played any of the anno series before will this be too complicated for a beginner loved your beta gameplay excited for these episodes keep doing what youre doing is there a creative mode where you have unlimited currency and can do what you want youll always be my favorite youtuber never get tired of your videos hope everything goes well to you and your family you deserve it i look forward to seeing how your empire evolves but even more curious to see how they made the first dreadnought the list of things i cant wait to see in this gameplay is practically endless xd george smith from 22 min got the same vioce as a pirate from anno 2070 pirate hector i believe grow with anno 1602 but lost interest since they make a future version hope this is good as old time i as a 13 year old like this game so much that my dad is going to buy it for both of us this is a win win listening to a charismatic voice while learning how to play my first anno game something i picked up from you i stop and take the time to admire the details wow im new here your voice sound so caml so relaxinglike it im having withdrawals i played the beta 48 hours straight now im locked out d am i the only one who is annoyed that the shadow bug is apparently still in the full game seriously the sun position should not be attached to the camera angle it just looks super weird when you rotate the fov i like your voice definitely those voice who would brought me to sleep i am happy i checked this game randomly and it was your channel you rock dude great work where is the cities skylines like for keralis to see i want tropico 6 damn i like the animation of the water i dont think my laptop can handle this poor me keralis please tell ubisoft to make this game available for mac users we cant play this awesome franchise i just watch keralis before sleep man i love your constant talk about ding dongs flapping about beautiful women and big titties you dont hear this good gentleman talk in the current climate of political fucking correctness cheers anyone else noticed how when you rotate the camera the light source stays fixed from right to left look how the shadows rotate at the same time with the camera its a mindfuck this looks very pretty but i miss penultimo finally am i the only one where the link does not work had an absolute blast playing open beta cannot wait for my copy to arrive oh man ive never been a huge fan of this not really played it much but this seems freaking amazing in so many ways i would love to get this game but epic is not available in my countrys currency and also they spy on my files on my pc and open way more ports than they should so i will skip the game if it will not be released on a trustworthy platform i subbed months ago because of this game and i didnt even know it existed youre the man i love it make this a series but dont forget bout tropica6 the open beta was a bit of a let down since theyre blocking gameplay pretty fast before you can work with iron they end the game and thats pretty early i dont feel like paying 60 for this either i mean its fun but not 60 fun where is evil bank of kerlais this game reminds me of tropico and this is yet another game that lacks trams yes horse trams big thing in 1800 this game is so chill and fun 3 is there any pc games like townsmen i like the gameplay of it cause it is very unique free rts games keralis roads are love roads are life this game is so beautyfull i can look at the water for hours tried it just now uuuh it is fun wasnt too lucky went into budget on my first travel to new world d i like when you say polish kielbasa i think you have try polish kilbasa because you know how looks anno and tropico 6 please fast missed this one minute im watching world news all tense and worried about this planet next minute im exploring a whole new world all relaxed and snug as a bug in a rug cheers keralismy saviour its not open beta you have to buy it to play how come i am getting insuffient workforce 340 and thats gonna be fiftydollarmazing huh every one who wants keralis to use only live pigs as food on his expeditions like this comment so he can see this its so morbid i love it because there are no actual harm in this just eat the whole pig in one and i promise everyone will like it welcome back have missed this title is this the full game or the open beta just curious because ive never played anno before but im testing the open beta i made 2 sandbox mode gameplays the first one i messed up but after watching some videos i figured out how to be efficient and manage multiple islands however the open beta doesnt let you upgrade artisans to engineers i had 100 of what was required to upgrade and the symbol appears to upgrade but the game wouldnt allow me to why dont you shutup while playing your voice is shit does a 1660ti 6gb oc can handle this game remember when he was a minecraft youtuber and playing attack of the b team oh wait am i the only one finally the hero is upload the full game episode i missed you man only way ill ever watch gameplay of this game is keralis im very salty to say the least that this game is going epic exclusive if i wasnt broke as a joke id buy this instantly luckily i can watch you play while i hope for 77 euros to drop into my lap somehow p keralis welcome back how often will you be pooping out anno episodes please say everydayy 3 no please stop no more anno do something different for break where is new video captain it is not a full game the game is still stripped and capped at t3 ok youve convinced me i sort of suck at these games but its just tooooo pretty and i wanna try it im downloading the open beta right now

wait to find you in my games hehe youre back how was the vacation glad anno is back really wanted this game but they decided to pull it from steam so now ill probably never own it because i cant support games that advertise on a platform then pull out of it where tropico 6 im falling asleep listening to your voice 3 my god 15 years and still dont have an auto explore i am not paying 5999 and the game dont have a simple feature use the small islands just for industry please dont turn into a channel that only uploads when sponsored who needs netflix when ive got you love your videos i might suggest that you put trees along roads so that your city will be more attractive love ur vids keep atem ps need longer vids plz oh yes ive been waiting for you to play the full game please do at least a hundred episodes of this i am dying to see your grids haha im so looking forward to this doubt that my 7 year old computer will do so ill have to stick to watching you anno 1404 works though i guess my son 4 years old will learn english with a keralis accent looking forward to tropico too keep up the good work keralis you are alive glad to have your lovely voice back i saw the notification and i rubbed my hands together love the way you play anno grid is king keralis enjoy every episode go big or go home will this game support mods yes its back im so happy this is starting again i love it only a person with a small ship would say its not the size of the ship that matter but the motion of the ocean i promise you that the size matters the ship doesnt have to be huge but a decent sized traitor how dare u forget presidente back to tropico i would suggest using that border map bay on the second island as military harbour and spare trade one in case first would be damaged because that bay just begs to be turned in to a pretty nice fortress really a beta 4 days before the game releases im sure theyll really take all that feedback and bug reporting and have time to fix loads of stuff before full release then i will be watching after work just wanted to say while im on break super excited thanks for being you and entertaining us love it see keralis upload a anno 1800 vid me yes

and youre getting me so pumped this game is just beautiful wow your voice sounds part of the game how do you make a game in 2019 that looks worse than a game that came out years ago you are so wholesome just seeing you play these games makes me happy oh i need to get this game its beautiful this brings me back to age of empires youre a great person and an awesome youtuber i very much appreciate the fact that you make sure everything is symmetrical i love this game amazing video and great commentary really enjoyable make more please you sound like memory story i didnt know this game was out until i randomly looked up sequel for anno 2205 and found this stumbled across your video while watching it thinking this game looks amazing until i notice the little gear icon on the bottom didnt have the hd flag over it i clicked it and found i was watching it in 360p i immediately switched it to 1080p and now i am sitting here drooling i am purchasing this tonight and going to try it out in 4k and hope my computer doesnt catch fire guys i cant download this game it need activation code who can give me the free download link this is so relaxing especially when you zoom in the game pls do zoom in more often so we can enjoy this game more and more thanks gorgeous game dont buy any game from ubisoft i warned you they will charge your card and not give you the game if you make a support ticket it will take 39 days to get a standard reply that they will investigate the problem if you look on internet yes i was stupid enough to do it before i bought it you see the problem is there for years why do you think they cancel the steam launch because they would get tons of negative reviews i do not say the games are bad just the platform the support and everything with ubisoft in the name is just pure horror this takes me back to the vibes with 1404 i couldnt get into the feeling of the last 2 futuristic ones this kind of past era is my home with the anno games though i really hope one day they do one set in the roman empire era no hope for ps4 release nice to see the symbols from anno 2205 hovering above the buildings d 610 i guess my father dieded lol man your voice is just amazing i can watch every video with your comments at 611 min you say obviously my father has died i hope so otherwise they buried him alivelol this game still need optimization its a bit disappointing i cant have slaves nor can i surpress protesters with firing squad lol characters are over dramatic btw does hannah have a silent button nice game great graphics im getting a really big settlers vibe from this who remember commandos game series eidos pyro studios where r u i was just looking for a gameplay video of this game and i ended up subscribing the way you play and explain things is awesome and i actually sympathized with you in that i just hate asymmetrical buildings and roads in short you just gained a fan keep up the good work ill be following normal difficulty really no true scotsman i hope they made the campaign 1000000x better than the last anno because 2205 has the blechest campaign ever ubisoft lost my support i own several of their products all bought thru steam no more money from me then ubisoft i will recommend this to my entire friends list and any platform i belong too will hear this message gaming is a multibillion industry let your voice be heard and say no steamsad a anno anime girls nearly everytime its a pun this is beautiful the graphics look muchly improved from anno 1404 which i play have been playing since 2014 im ready for this one so why did the date get pushed back i guess it needed to be worked on more nice to finally see someone who appreciates symmetry in these games enjoyed the gameplay a lot youve got yourself a new sub his voice bob ross relative jesus christ you place stuff faster than i could think never played this game before whats it about is it just a building game set in 1800 does the game evolve in time and better buildings and tech or does the time stay in 1800 does anyone know if this game will be also in ps4 greatly informing and entertaining video once again keralis thank you i got goosebumps when you expressed your love for and eagerness to play this anno game returning to its best setting realising your favourite youtuber loves a game as much if not more as yourself excitement is the only correct description my first was anno 1503 spend forever trying to optimize efficiency loving it all the way this one looks amazing too cant wait for my pioneers edition to arrive d ive been following you since cities skylines in the city of waterpoo and you deliver every single episode with your witty narration and soothing voice thank you keralis you make my day i hope steam ships can be created in this game before petrol engines also i think the author should think of where the wind blows as the pig farms seem too close to the houses i would create wheat farms closer to the houses though a matter of preference i guess never heard of this but wow is it fun to watch and your symmetry makes me so happy for sure binge watching this is this like caeser 3 where the buildings start shabby and they get upgraded with amenities food availibility etc i love that its not even released its just preview and yet there is a dlc bullshit activator so they already have planned out the dlcs so i hope this game will have a lot to offer in a base game its more like high mobile graphics the coal and steam engines in this port go through trevor philips industries or they aint going but ubisoft if someone want this game i have a 10 discount code oyausecv4cu9vhys is not much but i hope it helps how can i get it the beta versionthx watching this gamejst makes me wonder a custom mod game of this in the anime naruto konohathat wud be nicehaha seeing my ninjas walking aroundetc sorry if this is a dumb question yall but i see a decent amount of people playin this game and i dont know how because for me its not released yet and im wonderin how theyre playin any help is awesome yall bro your vice is so beautiful lets play videos tend to annoy me but you are like the bob ross of this genre so relaxing and enjoyable to listen to great vdeo great english but wierd accent that gets annoying after a while but you cant do anything about it keep the vdeos coming d baisons deelicious ovahere made me laugh lol appreciate the vdeo though ps anno needs to implement building time to buildings not instant building i think its time oh youll get use to the smell dude ok have you ever been to a real farm they smell horrible all farms that is why they are always in the boonies on the outside of town away from residential areas number 2 would you drive to the outskirts of town to buy meat and bread no you would not so why place your baker and butcher way out of the way they are always in town also why would you only have one market how realistic is that imagine if you only had one market it really sucks look up places that only have a walmart in town for shopping making game look pretty easy making gameplay last more than 2 hours hard everybody just aims for the easy and making it last for 2 hours so you cant return it i got burned on anno 2070 i was hoping for some complex island city building trade war action and got something fairly simplistic watching this to see if its actually going to be the game i wanted or more of the same after watching eh seems the same bisons is not a plural form one buffalo many bison holy shit santa maria is a whole other ship now p why not feature an african country they have more technology and economy wonderful video im buying this game when it releases your fault d thank you the fact that in the 1800s that many resources were left unclaimed completely ruins my immersion this game is so beautiful one thing thats bugging me is the unrealistic depth of field in many computergames makes the city look like its tiny whyyyyy i cant wait to play this great video any way to get into beta i saw something on the anno nation website but if i read it correctly it said you have to play 1 hr and write up things love it thanks bro game looks mint you have a very relaxing voice buy pre order or wait until summer sale need advice wow dident even knew this anno games existen and im still here playing banished but this look amazing i definitely appreciate ubisoft for being so active that they made such a detailed bulding strategy game i mean there are freaking foxes d but it feels kinda weird how the shadows of every object there are rotating with your camera finally a next anno 1604 im going to cry i still remember booting up 1602 and playing it for hours this looks so good and it has so many features from dawn this of discovery oh my god i cant wait idk who downvotes you bro you are a straight up sweetheart haha the soundtrack 917 paradise you mean that sea filled with dead corals and scraps of fishes with bloodshot eyes notodynamitefishing great video the 1st ive ever watched from your channel however it was very unsettling your choice of tone reminds me of a old man selling toys on christmas eve to kids as he also reveals some sort of magic get it kinda creepy i just bought this game and cant play beta version anyone know why this game looks great at last the freedom to build anywhere you want is back and sandbox is as well one of the main reasons i skipped the previous game keralis i had to say this mesa like trains apart from the graphics i see anno 2070 a lot in here is there nothing new except a different time period with all its stuff why could you only show 45 minutes this is the first time ive seen 1 of this guys videos and all i can think is hed be my number one pick to voice a khajiit in skyrim could you add what pc system youre running these games on please i played the beta and it wasnt anywhere near as smooth as your gameplay can you report that shadow is fixed and not rotate with camera change this is assumption light and sun is connected with camera but not earth basically its look like nice effect but not realistic i played beta but i cant find were to report this this video is amazing greetz from germany your voice is amazing to omg i want this game it better work on steam so far steam is hit or miss frostpunk dragon quest 11 civ 6 chrono trigger wont load but shadowrun battletech cats quest does and ff14 bdo wow all work fine and nothing anyone suggested fixed this yet crosses fingers is this game coming to ps4 413 what is with the floating chairs on the ship fish swarm its a school of fish god damn it p those guys are producing pigs like theres no tomorrow i played anno 2205 some times ago and i didnt like it my main problem was the soundtrack of game most of us use headphone when we playing a game and with bad soundtrack continuing game become impossible btw i will try to play that game again without those shet soundtrack before this one get release lets hope anno 1800 is better and will be as good as simcity it looks like a copy of life is fuedal forest village which was itself a better version of another game called banished the question is anno1800 better than forest village dno if this been asked but will there be land warfare or is it only ships the new rise of nations looks great got so many minor triggerings related to certain farmindustry and to certain extension useless roads hehe great gameplay overall the unrealistic grid style city is a bit strange but it looks like an awesome game well honestlyi never heard of you and had no idea the game was coming after watching you play and how u talk while u play made me subscribe and give you a thumbs up well done now i am actually looking forward to this game coming out since i was looking for a new city building game are you going to do a sandbox video too the reverb of your voice is unbearable 610 i guess my father diededok you should pronounce anno 1800 with two n with one n it means anus 1800 in italian i still play the first anno 1602 anno is a timeless game i regret not grabbing one of the keys for this when i had the chance lol really enjoyed the video especially how you take time to zoom in and show off the city folk at work and the beautiful graphics up close i am certainly going to own this game holy sheet i cant wait will this be for ps4 as well the only thing i can see so far thats mildly disappointing is still straight only roads sorry for destroying your houses humble people but i need this to be simetricall it would be so noiiice great video well done looks like a beautiful game 0915 lets start with some rozer say hello from scotland keralis has the best narration un whole youtube gamers that tnt explode facepalm oke this actually looks really good really like the look of this good preview im new to the game and i was wondering if the game is gonna be cheaper when its officially released rip real live i cant wait how can you be scared by a fire in anno xd this is my first video of yours ive watched and im so sure youre puss in boots behind a pc still remember how i played anno1503 more than a decade this video ended more times than return of the king this is what a video is suppose to look like absolutely beautiful the graphic artists need to be recognized for their work on these titles i also build anno settlements with grids like that im just happy im commenting in the same video grandma shirley commented you know how to play know very well anno game mechanics see a lot of noobs making movies like that one for anno series so bad they are so bad anyway is good to see ubisoft take some of the best things from anno 2070 use beautiful graphic engine form anno 2205 petty they seem dont take all good things from 2070 or maybe they will play now closed beta and for me isnt stunning but a good anno game i love this guys accent just got my key why does the shadow move with the camera xd this is so different than 1602 which is my all time favorite game i have all the anno games and love them all but 1602 is still my favorite will there be slaves thanks for your upload preordered dude you have such a professional voice your voice is so aristocratic that it has its own high phd degree in quantum mechanics btw i always appreciated anno games from deutschland greetings from italy if aarhant is sikh which im assuming he is based on the khanda brooch hes wearing then shouldnt he be wearing a turban as soon as you placed the houses i was like dawn of discovery the first video is saw from you damn you are a good player d nice vid already waiting for the full gameplay wow its like tropico i feel like youre trying to seduce my ear i enjoyed anno 2070 and 2205 was looking forward anno 2340 with maps being other planets in the solar system space battles and the end goal of being the first corporation to leave the solar system instead they chose to go back to the past nostalgia sucks just got into the closed beta hope to play it tonight or this weekend thanks for doing the first look banished game looks better and it is a 10 year old game i dont see the hype for this game looks awful as long as it has a black guy its diversity right is it really you dearest sibling i am moist it is you indeed your voice sounds like fernandos of west coast talk radio from gta 5 game is cool but dialogs are really confuse hmm i dont see any campaign this isnt beta im disappointed to see they still use the grid only 90degree roads why not open up the full spectrum of angles for buildings roads etc look like another mindless shit for overstress people who cant play any kind pvppve ubisoft could make age of empires 4 d buy the age of empires games you make a wonderful video mate keep up the great work i cannot wait to play anno im so sad its been pushed back to april but if the result is an aesthetically beautiful game it would be worth the wait loved itnow i know what to ask for my birthday the city in the intro reminds me of rdr2 saint denis who is this friendadvisor he has a sikh symbol but doesnt look at all like one you sound a lot like inigo from a skyrim follower mod i cant wait for this really good video thanks man anno 1500 spain rise of the first global superpower really good performance but i bet your rig is a monster with 1080ti i really wish they could have some variation to buildings just ruins the immersion when every fishery or every marketplace look exactly the same best game el presidente with argentinian flag and pirate symbol as an argentinian i can tell you got it right you are like the most inefficient anno player ive ever seen but still fun to watch d jup i will buy this one i cant wait whats with the atrocious lip syncing its like watching something from the 90s crazy beautiful amount of detail and then that this dude fucking loves poplar trees i havent played an anno game nor any buildertype game in literally decades but dang this is tempting i played so much 1602 ad back in the day haha im not subscribed and ive watched 2 of your videos including this one and you pop up in my recommended all the time im getting moist lol oh keralis you know me too well great gameplay thanks legend has it theyre still getting used to that smell thank you for the amazing video i love the anno series with a passion i cant tell you how happy and excited i am to see this game coming people we want bread and sausages and education keralis how much is the church then laughed so hard wow after watching this video im going right to steam to buy this game not its shabby but its my shabby 3 anno hopefully returns to its greater days wtf is wrong with shadows in this game why they rotate with you game looks super beautiful reminds me of emperor rise of the middle kingdom map looks pretty small and that was also the case befor we want bigger maps die multiplayer at least 10x10 the ons showing but horses with carts are broken just look how they turn around but isnt exit you play the game exactly the same way i do so it was a pleasure to watch you build who is going to eat all that anno i love the genuine joy on your voice looking like a nice game definitely going to buy that when i have a computer that i can run it anyone else getting triggered by the globalliberationarmy logo on that advisors vest what system you have no idea why this is on my recommendmaybe youtube realized its late and i need something to help me fall asleep i just really wish we could have curved or at least angled roads i have closed beta access but i wasnt planning on using it maybe ill give it a look i played the anno series from the very start but i didnt enjoy the latest one at all cant even think of its name this game looks amazing oh man i cant hardly wait love the annogames looking really forward for this iteration lower the volume of that micro boiits super annoying that looks so good cant wait better be on steam also i played anno 1602 and i loved it ive been dreaming of a remake of that game and this looks to be the cookie for me i love you keralis thank you for this video you brought this upcoming game to my attention whats your pc specification i am always very happy when release dates get pushed way better than launching half baked stop asking us to forgive you for looking around this game is freaking superb and if we were tired of you doing it your follower count would dwindle like mad cause of it cant wait for the final eee keralised version people read anno 1800 me anus 1800 0 gameplay all sweet talk and kissing up to the franchise this is an awesome game like banished sim city 3 and all the city simulators on steroids with astounding graphics thx for the video yay i got a key for the closed beta this weekend funny they called it anno 1800 it looks a lot closer to almost 1900 going by the ships canons vehicles and cranes i was waiting for a first look video cant wait untill thegame comes out 1 month and half for the release yes this is highly representative of the final product great commentary im totally gonna buy 1800 why is this video not in 4k come on hmm one question why the light changes with the camera rotation its shabby but its my shabby 3 can you see the war wow dude just wow great looking game hate the voice over about the smell though wish they tune it down i am surely part of those for which you talk too fast at least at 630 am 10 mins into the video i had to subscribe i dont even know what kind of channel you have or what kind of content you push now im writing my first comment in maybe years you i appreciate you keep up the good work is that a sikh symbol on that guy 149 im about to lose control and i think i like it 840 and i know i know i know i know i know i want you looks amazing and not so complex to play relly nice video and helpfully thanks cause of this video i preordered thanks keralis very very nice game but also its a pleasure to listen and watch to you i really enjoyed this vid yeah boiii ive got chosen to play the closed beta keralis you have a great sounding voice you in radio or television yet big career waiting for you man you know what this game needs trams and perhaps canals as well this game looks amazing game looks great but i am not a fan of the voice acting does anyone really care about all that chatterlol looks interesting but i want to see the military components ubisoft no thanks i dont care how good it looks keralis what are your computer specs you should try get a key for ancient cities looks like it should be good where are you from keralis they can push it back as long as they do that because they want to make the game better i would prefer a more polished game instead of mess of a game like mass effect andromeda fantastic first look at the gameplay ive been selected for the beta preloading it now can not wait for anno 1800 to be released havent looked forward to a game as much as this since 2007 wow tbc lol i cant wait for anno 1800 im sure ill like it i wish i could play anno games but they just do not work properly on my system ubisoft will find a way to ruin it youre the first youtuber that plays sim game without an unbearable voice gg i love anno but honestly it doesnt look like theyve evolved much in the past 10 years how are you playing this already keralis you should keep playing and try to figure some things in this game out but then make another video were you make more videos about this game it looks just like another dlc of 1404 i like how keralis says bushes booshes show framerates plz why cant they just produce a annoframework and let the modding community developspecific features just subbed this is what im looking for a genuine gamer i like how excited you are lol i dont really know anything about anno games but this looks pretty cool are there any anno games i should play before this one im getting moist oh thats not the right word i am quite moist too watching this preview really love a good anno game your voice keeps me focused ty sirthe game looks amazing i wonder why nobody made game like this with pvp and fps view feature what are the specifications of your computer keralis ive been playing anno since 1602 but i think my pc is no longer up to spec your voice is really amazing thanks for the video im going to play some anno 1404 while waiting for this gem to come out graphics look really amazing gameplay looks very interesting really looking forward to see more videos and have added this to my wishlist on steam a must buy cant wait that moment when you want a game but pc to weak ok ill wait for your lets play ok please post and ill subscribe only this what are your specs i love the anno games seems interesting but its made by ubisoft goddd i want to have a voice like your i dont care whatever the price i will buy this as soon as its launch hype for months now why now after the release stay on februar comes message ups we must work longer at game and release is now first on april so a sh is this game of thrones the intro seems similar first time channel watcher your voice is amazing thank you for blessing my ears i just watched this and barely made it through the video the repetitive comments made constantly by the people ohh youll get used to the smell will be stuck in my head forever definitely wont get used to that glad i saw this before spending money on it cant wait to download and play this awesomeness thanks much for your preview im looking forward to your playthrough of this i love this guys voiceit just makes games more fun to learn about haha anyone ever tell you that you sound like a millennial version of antonio banderas hmm game looks great too why do amsr channels exist when the polish accent exists keralis could say literally anything and it makes me happy just to hear his voice first video and i already used to the smell this game looks amazing in 1500 fishing boats werent worth it i wonder if they balanced them better in this game amazing look to this game but i am confused about something the entire look of the game the architecture technology and fashion and the references to a queen are all out of place for the year 1800 it looks much more like it is set between 18501890 somewhere within the british empire queen victoria if thats the queen they are referring to in the game dialogue wasnt even born in 1800 she was born in 1819 and she ascended the thrown in 1837 sorry for being a pedant still it looks like a cool game and i appreciate the artistry of the world creation cant wait amasing game please so more in the future i love your videos with your calm voice xd please do a whole series asap now thats some strong ocd this town looks amazing good sir definitely inspiring for other city build gamers and for the future of them as well ubisoft nough said this dude sounds like he should be voicing over games i like what theyve done with farms this guy gets money for playing games that arent even released yetwhat the hell did i do wrong ooooh mama def gonna buy it thanks for the nice preview enjoyed watching as always im so excited i just cant hide it 839 am i seeing right there are no hammers that ui is kind of confusing to me this guy sounds like the male commentator off jane the virgin will you be doing this more in the future can i choose a syphilis riddled whore as my character if not why not this is like tropico 6 on steroids looks really good though so everything insta builds no construction time lol game for casuals in this times gamers need games like this one like desert water as a swede im embarrassed by your presentation it feels contrived ill look for another gameplay video with less intrusive commentary keralis stop tempting us with unreleased games dawn of man is not out and you hype us with another cool one your voice so nice very nice combination with this game and nice commentary introducing hills to make cities look awesome was probably the best idea of the anno creators yet 2034 general kenobi damn the game looks great cant wait 3400 fire screams disasters how about a cup of coffe what is wrong with the shadows you are moving the sun moar we need moar the bob ross of youtube your voice is so relaxing calm and steady really loved your way of playing and loving i played the 1602 1702 1440 for quite the time had a little look to the 2070 and 2250 or whatever is the date loved the old style but didnt really like the modern ones 1800 should really get me back to the game especially after seeing your video for my pocket its expensive but its a 45 star rating to me you know in quebec farms are long strips just like your farms no curved roads i envy you so much ive been playing anno since 1503 keep up the good work the shadow moves with the camera rotation is this a bug cause it looks wrong this game looks so perfect play lots of freeplay until the game is out pls damn bro you have the perfect voice for npr wait nevermind you articulate well and dont have mouth noise constantly seaching people in the city of anno 1800 in a 4k resolution ist impossible 1927 wellits pretty enough just a shame that you can only build in squares seemingly i know its not possible yet but i really wish the anno series could come to consoles i think this game looks great its been a very long time since i have played this style of game however this one is going on my to buy list this year this game looks awesome cant wait to play it 3 i will never be able to aford this game its so expensive i think from an aesthetics point of view the fact that you plop down buildings is a frickin tragedy there should be construction animations i hope there will be no microtransactions in it this game is beautiful keralis thank youuuuuu this was the best video and i cant wait for more to come i love that you always say goodbye and then still do some little things its like you cant stop playing hihi loved it i liked anno 2205 now this one seems even better because its set back in the 1800s i cant wait to play it someday you are one lucky man the game releases on my birthday though so thats already a good present d mouth animation is weirdxd cant wait to play this game nice i know you gonna get one of this the exaggerated accent my god this game looks realy good this game will be released on my birthday this game seems to be awesome and i would like to se more of it woow amazing details and the colors are sharp as it should be this is a must buy and a must watch please make a long series for this one so we can see all the features and buildings this game offers will it be on console really hope they take a look at the combat system something more then just shooting the warehouse to claim the island love your vids btw is it me or does his voice make the video 10x more interesting i want this game now thanks keralis for making me want to buy another game when i cant afford it grrrrr and now i cant wait and its pushed back well thank you keralis this will be perfect i m hoping they are adding far east why is there bison in the old world bring back the pixel art version i havent even played the game yet and i already know how i want to organize my city xd gods this looks so beautiful i had a little bad feeling of ubisoft and victorian era dont trust on marxists when representing the era of their lord and savior but this anno is just beautiful so they will have free play they learned from their mistakes this is an absolutely fantasticlooking game im so excited for its release and cant wait to play it also you and i play with about the same level of obsessive organization keralis i enjoy that supremely ohh youll get used to the smell please please more more more more more lovely gotta try this one out when i getz bak anybody else notice the floating benches on the ship in the beginning lol leave me alone keralis you are amazin the witcher 3 of anno every time i look forward to this game i remember that its ubisoft theyre going to ruin this franchise like all the others looks like a wonderful game i cannot wait oooooh looks all amazing cutscene pans to ditchwater first thing i hear an npc say when is the next freighter due silently screams on the inside not my anno villagerovertime is killing my family time keralis oohhh that little girl has a balloon hahahaha subed right there i love this game i had a key for it from intel but for some reason it wont work looks gorgeous and a worthy successor to the late great anno 1404 as always in the anno series the graphics music and animations are top notch none of that toy look or primary colours proper 19th century architecture with an eye for detail looking forward to its release also unlike many other building games there is charm life and character this game will be a very big hit ewmygewd those grids hurt my eyes xd anyways love your video i love the way you show us the buildings and animations not many do that i want this game i have been so hyper excited ever since the game had been announced i already preordered it last year and i am so sad that the release is now later it would have been during my holidays but of course it is always better to get a better product and to wait for it a bit longer than the other way around love the video and i was so sad at the end because i wanted to see moooore p let them delay the game as long it comes out right where is the icon that shows how much foodfish is in storage i can only see the one for timber im moist aswell keralis dont worry i need more of this thanks for this first look the anno franchise is awesome i still have a 2205 play through in my rotation i am looking forward to playing 1800 myself and also hanging out with you as you do a playthrough of this game man you have a fantastic narrative voice love it when is the next episode of cities skylines coming out to be honest the graphics look outdated especially the faces and facial animations are horrible pleasecontinue with anno 1800am really enjoying itam surprised you have not released part 2 yet i came to look at it fantastic video i cant wait to play i love those grids keep them coming even grids you can make look great the rival citys best friend is a sikh and yet he doesnt wear a turban i shall report

banderas this game is too beautiful hello keralis i cant wait to play this gamewhen it is release this is sooo beautiful o oh i need this game asap d well to be perfectly honest in my humble opinion of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of ones views and by trying to make it objectified and by considering each and every ones valid opinion i honestly believe that i completely forgot what i was going to say ohhhhh youll get used to the smell 3 omg its all coming back the music the same sized buildings 3 ive spend weeks in 1404 min maxing the hells out of everything im so excited i just cant hide it keralis will we get to see your zoo soon cuz im eager to see it pardon my rush smashing subscribe button lol maaaaaannnnn i wanna play this right now i cant wait please god help meeeee plss make this a series 1950 you can see flying lady over a building d omg its coming out on my birthday guess what am treating myself too gorgeous game beautiful town well done keralis well watching you play this game sadens me since you totally ignored the main buildings affective areas of coverage your city should be dead by now but it is not you should of lost this game every building you forceablly upgraded should be vacant for the most part since those buildings were all outside of coverage is this like an age of empiressimcitycities skylines game or civilizations it showed up in my recommendations looks interesting really nice looking game i build with symmetry as well so i enjoyed your city building style im always happy to hear when a company has the integrity to not release a unfinished game early welli am not going to get it until steam has the summer discount week anyway so i guess it will be around the third week of june before i get it anyway travels 500m from the big city thats it ditchwater the end of the world xd im a new viewer and holy shit your voice is so awesome to listen to in headphones are they gonna be like building animation or its just straight up done building i didnt play anno before it looks like a nice game im hoping to have it one of my favorite game series of all time so happy to see them go back to a historical setting looks fantastic i have been waiting and waiting since it was first announced guess i can wait a little moreandat the same time really looking forward to playing this game as a big fan of anno 1404 also your road layouts are very pleasing huge fan of grids and symmetrical building placement haha his voice is so soothingam i the only one the art style is gorgeous damn thats beautiful glad there are studios out there still pushing their license and not just reusing the same old tech such a shame that the game got delayed i want to play it as soon as possible all i could think of when you saw the sheep farm was ooooohhhh sheep xd you sir deserve a medal for this beautiful building style very excited for this game great video watched you play this game i will agree its amazing so ive signed up for the open beta to try for myself keep up the good work the only anno i have played is anno 1404 loved it to death until my laptop died this video made me wanna try this new game but i have a huge problem is only for windows i hate that i dont want to buy a pc just for this anno series needs to be available in macs asap did they bring back land military units like in anno 1701 shit farms play more for some reason i find your voice really intriguing but soothing lol you sound like you should be narrating a movie ahaha ist that really the voice of victor saltzpyre from vermintide 2 xd city skylines great gameplay btw he have an army over here that one big army of 6 horsemen where did u make your intro still straight roads and 90 degree bends you know a game is going to be bad when it comes out with dlc been pushed back so they can add microtransactions super thank you i dont mind when developers push back a release date like the great miyamoto said a delayed game is eventually good but a rushed game is forever bad this game will release to macos so you can show 45 minutes of footage and you make 40 minute video you monster d but seriously now this looks absolutey gorgeous i completely agree that anno is at home in the past the modern and futuristic ones are fine but thit is where the magic happens i am probably a bit different to you when playing strategy games like this one i doesnt care too much about stuff being symmetrical and looking pretty but more about that shit works and gives an income so that i am able to support my growing city and to develop the new stuff i will need later on oh youll get used to the smell oh youll get used to the smell oh youll get used to the smell lol more end goal for dis game kill edvard the a hole aaaayyy and i tought im the only who cares that buildings should be cemetrical could you place fire departments near the the grainlivestock production it would take very long for them to get there otherwise reminds me of age of empires 3 edit and tropico the last one released i cant fucking wait wowat last somethinggo to radionice voice oh i am loving the looks of it i paused the game long enough to create an ubisoft account in anticipation of the launch of this game i already see me playing this game for countless hours i am currently relearning banished and using mods for the first time i played banished back in 2014 when it was first released and played for about a year ive retired from playing world of warcraft after 10 12 years due to extreme unhappiness with the direction of the game loving the possibility of this game and hope it is released quite soon i want to see more of this game well i know what game i am buying in april looks really good and fun to play i love the video and i love your accent x x x we want more p i love it i cringed when he said he feels moist is there an ingame annopedia available the 16th of april is my birthday assassins creed syndicate yea i really want to see more tttt man your voice is so smoothing any chance you can do an asmr gameplay video is it me or the announcer is the same from the guild 2 i love anno games ive been playing them since 1602 im so happy you had a chance to play and share this i cant wait for this game to come out looks amazing back then i played anno 1404 and anno 1701 both were awesomeanno is one of the rare ubisofts ip that is still awesome loving the gameplay my god this game looks great and all those little details just as a tip when placing houses in anno 1800 its best to do it a tiny bit different then in the other games leave one free row of space behind andor to the side of them do that for every single house and fill the empty rows with decorations yes i know it might seem like a waste of space in the first stages but belive me when i say this once you unlocked tourism you will thank god that you did it since its basicly constant free money like a lot of money seriously you wont even be able to spend all that money it also increases the happiness of the people living in the house which equals more taxes so again free money this reminds me of banished very much when i saw anno in the titlei clicked right away one of my favorite games beside of city skyline this is the most relaxing video thanks for vid have played every anno so far n from what iv seen i will def play this 1 now i will also have to dream of anno 1800 thanks keralis cant wait to see your lets play of the official release its british imperialism time keralis my man i love the anno videos ooooh shit love this game always a pleasure watching your vids keralis but maan that ocd for the grid layout kills me everytime need that bit of creative side mr although good vid as usual keep it up whos gonna eat all this its so nice playing this game but my suggestion is why your make it the residence in every corners of something like farm storage and near the mountains and stop create next to something like the windmill i think its better built it not in each other its better in the cliff near the end of wheat field its accurate when you put in there the wind blows on that side i would have put the windmills closer to the beach and not have trees in front of the sails flashback to rimworld guessing this will never come to console exciting nice watch a long expected game i a wating for this series along with tropico details are so beautiful first taste of this anno really enjoying the content with all the first looks for the upcoming games and your accent and commentary big thumbs up loving all the work you put into showing us all i am soooo looking forward to this game edvard is pierre richard reinstalled anno 1404 after watching this 3859 i have the feeling that he really means it oh damn it now about 30 minutes into your video i have to buy it this game has a beautiful soundtrack finaly workers are part of mechanic no more people paying tax and not working p looks really nice ive played 1602 a lot in the past may look into this one i really love how they worked with the fans to make a good game i was at a market research around 2 years ago about this game i saw artwork pictures covers game titles and they talked about some game mechanics like a train it was so cool and im glad i was there so this is simcity in a larger scale any games like this out on console so exciting wait for more episode since the first time i played anno 1440 i wondered why the hell is sunshadows rotating with the camera and it is still a thing several games later anyone suspects any reason for that heloo i always love your videos can i ask about your pc settings thank you oh youll get used to the smell the ingame characters when they are idle not talking look very funny if you look closely xd is there any public transit in this game 3145 was expecting freedom eagle sound most beautiful strategy game ive seen no wonder you have been dreaming about this game cant wait for this game amazing game thank you for this video love it ooooh youll get used to the smell i cant wait for el presidente to return cant wait for this game it looks so beautiful its emotional i should unsubscribe from your channel if i have to avoid bankruptcy love your reviews and gameplay videos ever since i found your channel ive been buying games youve played and enjoyed playing them as well and guess which game is on my wishlist now ugh keralis youre digging a hole for city skylines w all these other city first looks im a anno fan among all anno games anno 1404 is my favourite i dont like futuristic games but this may replace anno 1404 as my favourite im okay with the release date being pushed back a bit it means theres more time for bug fixes cant wait for this incredible aaahhh the smucksi was hoping they realese it in februarywell at least the game is gona be better look at aarhants badge hes a sikh is tropico without tunnels jealous i also want to play anno you are too lucky they moved it again to april 16 ffs i like this type of games i wish i can have it please continue making video for this game why are so many city builders getting pushed back tropico 6 got put off to march i am made of salt its beautiful i hope you know you will get used to the smell the only question i have is did they get use to the smell i need this game now wtf release date got pushed back i planned my holidays occordingly keralis how i get this game free from torrent what do you want to bet that the brother is the actual traitor nobody commenting on the music its epic as it always is with anno games cant wait for this sucks that it was delayed till april but rather have a more polished product how are u playing this im dying to play a new city builder more soviet republic if you place the sheep farm within the range of frame work knitters or wool converting workshops then the workers there will pick up the resources directly from the farm when they are produced not needing to go to the warehouse to pick them up and that will cut one step in the supply chain which is the warehouse picking up resources from farms then work shops and factories having to pick the resources from the warehouse and that will save a lot of time storage space and cost of warehouses i dont know if anyone can understand what i am talking about p you do realize that your grids are actually not efficent at all right youre ending up with squares empty just because you refuse to do roads asymmetrically and furthermore even in real life cities like in cities skylines having a tight grid layout is actually also inefficent as heck because you end up with around 33 of the entire surface area of the city being just roads even discussing traffic its actually worse still because each intersection reduces traffic flow and causes congestion not residences not commercial districts not industry just road surface 33 of the entire space wasted juuust saying maybe its time to wane off that obsessive compulsion be free keralis be free like the wind build any shape in any way you can dont be mentally restrained by your obsession with grids itll be the end of you xd xd does this game is in spanish i can not wait for this game to come out it looks amazing i notice its from ubisoft so i guess well have to use that crap uplay then bring back tropico i am kinda disappointed that anno went backwards as i love the future ones but as an anno fan i will end up buying this even if i am disappointed that it wont go further into the future but thanks keralis for sharing the games as always i enjoy watching you play the games my jaw droping and cant speak make it series mr keralis 3 omg i hate that cowclicker bullshit of clicking random spawning resources on the map to pick em up that such gamey mobile game arcade nonsense damn now im scared about the timer over the buildings that get constructed would not be surprised if they have gems to skip those timers otherwise why even have timers for construction god damn please dont ruin this game no confidence in the devs after the space anno that deleted half the game mechanics and random maps i cant fg wait to play with this one was quite dissented with the last 2 been playing 1404 for the last week or 2 so looking forward to the release of this game looks amazing ill watch you play it buddycause uplay makes my computers skin crawl good video as for your grids it is similar to how i would do it this and workers and resources need to become fleshed out series game looks amazing but at 80 cad ill wait for a 75 off sale damn this looks goodgg social life why do you found game i love before i do lol dude i had no idea this game existed im so hyped oh yes more plz uhm youll get used to the smell play a lets play anno1800 looks awesome and keralis your play through is just as amazing as ever nohaters keralis what are the specs on your pc please play game more please make it into a series game looks great but it forces you to use uplay i was going to steam to buy after seeing your video but instead decided to boycott ubisoft after reading they force uplay down your throat can we play dis with our patatoes d looks good prolly needs a fast one good choice to come back from space d looks amazing and i cant wait to put my hand on thanks for preview k but even though i understand it is just first look at new anno and you can showcase us just litlle bit and pieces i have to say to something bad what makes me uncomfortable you used to be good with decorations and detail working thats why i started follow you years ago i have became obsesed with details and decorations like you touch us so many times please dont rush games to the end as fast as possible like you doing these days make me sad panda hey keralis i was thinking that you could do separate seasons for each difficulty or unless its what you decide damn that game is awsome i want more viedos from this game psyour city is cool and i like grides style too its the most simple and practical way to build city its the best way for campain in my opinion d i love your chanel please do more that stuf and another stuf like that imagine dawn of man with these graphics im getting so wet i wont kink shame you there i cant wait to see the inevitable series that comes when this is released keralis you play anno like i do long road lines and grids getting very annoyed when new buildings dont fit in nicely im brazilian and i live in a place in brazil disputed by portugal netherland and france back then we still have some french fortifications near my hometown this game is awesome because i fell the same feelings when i was back in the school listening to history class nice one keralis looking like the best anno yet imo more fire stations with better coverage and work on you navy and military this is a beautiful game umm excuse me no bendy road your brother is hiring agents to commit arson anno1800 looks amazing i cannot wait to get my hands on this game itll fit my channel perfectly well done keralis well done the detailed visuals are beautiful but i do not like the shadows always being cast right to left when you change the view is that a graphics options that can be changed the visual effect is the camera is stationary and the whole world rotates weird 3 things keralis first of all another game with bushes i following you maybe since your first banished series and i have to tell you you were the first foreign im from hungary youtuber i started to follow i really love how you making your videos i like your accent and your voice is so calming i confess there was a couple times i watched a banished video late night and i fell asleep its such an entertainment i get so excited when i see you uploaded something last but not least about the grid theres a tons of reasons in real life and also because most of the games doesnt support curved roads tropico does but not fullywhy one of the most efficient way to build a city in a grid first of all you dont necessarily have to turn so if you going straight you can travel the shortest route between two points if you have curves or shifted streets you have to take some extra meters i dont think it counts in this game but in real life every turn takes they need a gold thumbs up button oh yeah i cant wait to put my hoofs on this game good to see uk english being partially used license should be licence in the context of the scene the lack of it in games ruins immersion for me and results in a lost sale its so simple to create two english versions yet few companies bother and thats one sale lost ive preordered thanks ubisoft and developers for including engb and thanks keralis for showcasing the game in your usual unique style even with dishwater you do amazing stuff water wheel on that ship is far too low only very lowest part should be in water not half or more i have to wait till after my exams oh good actually thanks guys i never played any anno game but this one will be for the books the details i see are just out of this

about the game so far beyond excited for this game yay i was hoping you would do this one and first where is cities skylines second its here anno 1800 ive signed up for the anno 1800 beta like if you have first any plans to release anno 1800 drm free also would be nice to get it in a nice package 1404 will forever be the best one for me is the gold edition 95 worth it if this had been 80 there is no way i would have bought it before few days i again installed old anno 1701 and played on pc haha i would buy the game but uplay dawn of discovery 20 edition if you segregate the working classes from the upper classes will the ai react with roits or unhappynessor whatever else it can do beautiful but the voice acting is super annoying 81 should have got an 83 the guy speaking in this video doesnt make sense comparing a builder game with a first person shooter seriously and slow down man i bet i was not the only person in the world who had to rewind this video several times to understand what he was even saying there is no need to talk at the speed of a airplane crashing down to earth lol why does the game look so choppy this is much better than civilization this isent ps4 game if you want an anno game just get anno 1404 same game just cheaper less then 7 pound right now same game and it still looks nice even today with regret i had to realize that i could not watch it to the end the text was clearly written by someone who has never touched a piece of anno in the past years painful are you hiring can i kill my enemies watch them flee before and hear the lamentation of their women its 60 euros on epic lol sorry i prefer age of empires no loot boxes 81 is that pirate looking guy a sikh he has the sikh khanda on his lapel as a pin these games look boring as hell sorry but no that looks like garbage 2019 and we cant have modern graphics in this city builder no thanks lol dilligence pays off with addiction sounds great just like learning to enjoy scotch it is a disappointment of a game unfortunately it bores after two days and will not have mods 81 i think the score is a 9 then p at first i thought the wakes were an odd nitpick but now its all i can see they are terrible will someone please explain the difference between 81 and 83 or 79 comparing a city management to a fps really its been pulled from steam im not signing up with their store for just one game too bad since it had been in my cart but i missed the email i would definitely buy if it were on steam shame on that epichit store compare to a first person shooter kill streaks serious ign how does that make sense in any way losses points for not being on steam question disregarding price which anno game is the best im new to the series sadly they made a bad move not selling the game on steam i pass anno 1404 had a lot of maps for campaign anno 1800 just 1 still bugs in game still no dlc even if it says it on the website it would come out same time as the game 81 wtf try a 9 out of 10 this is a great game also this isnt an rts this is a city builder with lite sea battles when im not sure if i want to buy a game or buy something useful i come to ign reviews so i dont buy games how can you review this in 4 minutes smh love it cant wait to come back from bali and play it its not a real time strategy game though its a city builder enjoying the game thoroughly in sandbox looks great cant wait till it goes on sale so i dont have to buy it overpriced for me this game is 9510 05 for some bugs if youre a fan of city building game strategy game historylover must play this amazing game why just 81 if you are just critical to its tutorial had no idea this was a city management game lot of ubisofts graphics for this made me think it was something like assassins creed or far cry this game is boring its nothing new from the last game as far as graphics or sound its blah this game is way more interesting than its previous installment but i was hoping for something new in a new game new graphics and sound i fall asleep playing this and thats no lie i sincerely appreciate how ign reviews games others wouldnt they sure fill the gap of information found out about dragons dogma way back when among other jewels now under appreciated underestimated or those great games you never knew about kind of thing keep it up the game missing the steam engine so 81 requires spyware launcher to play thanks but no thanks a 9 is only reserved for nintendo how would the colonized feel about this game 81 do your job properly and review world war z only thing missing is scenarios and different campaign maps sandbox gets trivial i want the challenges just remember back to the pirate challenge in anno 1602 or imperator challenge in 1404 it looks way better than it does in this review guys come on 01 bonus is for the encouragement this type of game is dying the society is not tropico and simcity game deserved a lot higher than 81 now thats its not on steam i guess i wont be able to experience this awesome looking game great game been playing it since the open beta sad thing is you cant build armies like in the civilization games reason why i wont get it epic store exclusive thata very sad i almost fell into a come during this review great game but its missing the scenarios of anno 1404 what thumbnail is that from people still play 2d games in 2019 okay fire them fuckers they cant even defeat gyobou a penalty for each death should be deducted from their shitty wage epic store exclusive easy pass thank you epic for helping me save money 81 is maybe a jokereference towards the numbers in every anno game adding to 9 please stop with the pretentious review scores skip it its on epic game store only and not worth your money reviewed by charles singletary jr perfect name for a reviewer of this game no steam yes buy the beta was excellent definitely going to pick up cant wait to see that spiffing brit break it 81 is such a random score lol does it require a powerful computer what a game yo i remember playing this game series on windows98 way back i was just remembering this game today i used to play it in my nokia and its was really hard to keep everyone happy but now its a massive pc game with really great graphics i feel proud of play the roots of this game now just when i think its was lose in the time 33 hours straight lmao please send help i hate this genre learn from real developers jurassic world evolution team with no air or marine units in 2019 i want to see the ign rating system go upto two decimal olaces and give this game a score of 801 tried this series for the first time when the beta was up and i enjoyed it and bought it been hooked to this 15 hours spent on it already but still prefer tropico 6 been looking forward to this then ubisoft took epics money and pulled it out of steam its as bad as the last one more casual and risk free just make buildings no penalty wheres the world war z review is this coming to xbox or playstation everybody hates on ign but at least theyre the only ones that review a lot of games for us to decide whether we are interested or not some may not like the reviews but at least appreciate the fact theyre reviewing it respect it they really named a game anno why 81 whats the difference between an 8 and an 81 whens the world war z review coming how does the game perform does it require a really powerful computer or can it get by on a laptop tf you just took down your own video how does it run on pc is there coop in this game or player versus player that part of review wasnt expanded on anno means back then in hungarian lol i remember playing this on my nokia feature phone who else thought this was the new madden game buthole is this a game i might want to check out 81 great saved you time dont know this game first first where would be the best site to buy this game at one of my all time favourite games is anno 1404 1800 is an amazing game and follows the 1404 roots unlike other games they made caugh 2205 couch hannah is moany for somebody that got given an island i wish kos would be my mommy so ok i love this game but i am having loads of difficulties with city placement and finances i end up bankrupt every game i attempt any tips mostly looking for help for the campaign seems like there is a lot of frame dropping hopefully they are able to polish that on release right now my wife and me dont do netflixchill but katherinecoffee soo much better id decided not to buyplay anno 1800 but watching you having so much fun playing this game makes my resolution waver lol thank you for this playthrough 3 the one kind of annoying thing to me is how were taxing the crap out of the unemployed so far it seems like a solid strategy to just spam housing since having a surplus of workers doesnt seem to affect anything at least until you can start establishing trade routes and earn money that way is there an easy way to identify just how many work clothes you need to make to satisfy x population this game is so relaxing to play lady i dont know about you but personally i get really stressed out when i get repeated messages of quests warnings of fires ships attacking quests farmers shortage diplomacy updates quests etc etc oh did i mention about quests wish i could pause the game so i can in peace lay out foundations and city plans without having to break in the middle to take care of something totally different on the other side of the world i love the game but damn the game really is stressful and not relaxing at all imho p something interesting for you to know katherine is that when it comes to blast fishing such as what you did at the very beginning of the game doesnt actually burn the fish explosions come in several parts and the heat is quickly dissipated by the water but the concussion that actually kills or stuns the fish doesnt burn anything so those fish wouldnt be blistered or burnt theyd maybe be tender with all their bones broken though edit i know youve already moved past this point by a great deal but may i suggest using the apple trees for decorations a lot and renaming it to applewater it seems fitting with your tone of voice and such i cant really explain it better than that i own 2070 and i jumped on the open beta for this its beautiful and the qol they have in this vs 2070 is pretty awesome i would like to get 2205 and 1800 katherine has a very calming disposition she soundsfeels like a friend mom and teacher all in one with how she acts im actually follow your videos so i can build my city like that so im awful at these sorts of games but they are just so fun to me when set on casual if you like stress and upkeep thats 10000 okay ill never rag on players for choosing harder games im like you and its nice to see someone play on a custom setting looks like a fun game but not sure if i want to shell out the 60 asking price for it great video thanks while im very excited to see you play this game again im afraid i must dislike for the audio i cant hear anything of the story or game voice acting van hemelen is actually a proper dutch surname or flemish i want this game so badly if only i could afford schnapps are not made from potatoes but from fruit quite disappointing that the game developers messed this up well done your acuity in managing this venture is wondrous indeed the open beta is nothing more than a teaser demo the mission will stop abrubtly after about an hrs gameplay when you are asked to pay bail to free the demolition guy and sends you back to main screen dont know what sandbox is like but seems useless to have an open beta when you can only play about an hr of the campaign rich people logic things are bad better buy an island something ive always loved in these games is how alive the cities feel and i find myself caring a lot more about layout and terrain than in other games im going to make the same comment i made on your vid of tropico one of my favorite gameseries with the best voice on youtube recipe for fun it looks like if you connect road to ruins ruins brake after 5 seconds this game is great after playing 10 hours i am not sure how the trains will fit into the gameplay but it looks like there are lots of cool stuff that opens up at end game certainly looks better then the last anno ive been playing this series since the 1st version being pissed off by ubisoft at some point prolly most would agree besides that you deserve far more subscribers you have a lovely voice more then suitable for a presenter im not sure if it matters but i noticed you only put up 71 of 72 potato fields across the bridge had no idea the game was so close to being release that kos is going to to do a play through is just a bonus where does kos get all the time must be a master planner with time i like anno but ubisoft has burned me a few times already so am going to wait until a sale to buy this until then i will just watch your videos xd wait wait i see gasp a train in the main menu of course cant wait to play it next week isnt this frospunk ive got a few names 1nordlicht 2lumiere du nord 3severnoy siyaniye if you liked at least one of them please like i was in sainsburys yesterday and got a discounted bag of cookies for 40p im eating them now theyre ok oh hey anno is back hurray you know when you think that something is cooluntil you do it 300 times then it just becomes tiresome glory to raptoria asking why the moral starts so low well maybe they are going after a lost ship in the freezing cold the few words that confused you trodden and sodden and one other i cant remember must be from the uk as i knew them all is this game available on mac can it be played on android you made me spend 45 bucks in 7 minutes good thing i decided to check this video out got the deal just in time i think any1 facepalmed when he didnt take the relics lol hi i downloaded the free demo but it doesnt start very strange because my laptop has excellent requirements did any of you have a similar problem i also wanted to ask if if i bought the game but it didnt work does epic games or ubisoft refund it do you

time and play this weekend wheres the sunken treasure video amazing game play i started to watch just to see how the game is made and if i will like it so i can purchase it but your game play is so immersive i stick around for the complete series what program do you use to record screen footage audio thanks how do you get the view to street level play in hard mode this is mega overkill i have watched all the episodes of this game i have really enjoyed watching so much now i want to get one for myself thanks for sharing this game is so full of bugs its not funny its actually unplayable there is literally hundreds of annoying bugs and they kill the game for example the newspaper is always gone before i can edit anything it never says anything until it goes ships on patrol sails right past pirates ffs set ships on patrol they stop and just sit there while pirates sail past yes the settings are set correctly ive played a few hundred hours and this always happens the bloody keypad stops working at least 3 times a night just reboot again i get warnings that are incorrect say a hops field warning tells me i havnt placed enough fields click on the hop building and it tells me its fields are full and this goes on and on i cant believe they released this incomplete game when its in such a state what a waste of money very nice ill watch tha in stores at a good price perfecion fore this kind of pc game cooslvile and it also has an obvious dramatic story anno 1800 in 16 aprilie 2019 goood shit yeaaaaa give that for 25 but maximum because here in romania it stil is tha financial crisis of 1992 so i do not give anything more then theat when it will fix the problme yes until then sory but i have to say it can not be anymore and guilty to go to the barrel of oil because it has increased 4x than it should im really upset and thats gonna be all over they have also been to planetary misinformation sources since 2011 thei wil would burn for it just to make it clear all from 1970 how misinformation and disinform especially officials etc 015 spank you very very much what a legend well played keralis well played indeed thank you keralis enjoyed all 15

minecraft server you are terrible at planning a war lol squadrons of 4 bc and putting them on his shipping routes and escorts of 2 on your main routes the rest is half at home as reserve the other

this episode is filled with boom boom and more boom but it had to be done thank you karalis no dont end it finally last episodo really love anno 1800 series by the way what about surviving mars ive waited too long where is tropico 6 where tropico comrade i realy wanna tropico finally third keep all the good work first enjoyed your first video sooo much it ended up me playing until 0500 the next morning thanks for the guidance thats cool erm no pasteurs disinfection campaign only took hold in the late 19th century and semmelweis was put in the madhouse for his idea of doctors needing to wash hand before delivering babies it was pretty common for children to die at a young age and even those who survived had to follow a strict social code where your character was taught to live a life of a businessman like your uncles character she was raised to marry someone and leave the household now of course shes already rebellious since she spent her dowry to buy the island you develop yet still she follows social rules just enough to address you a person she barely knows properly the punishment doled out for the perceived crimes is totally in sync with the justice system of the time thats how you got australia whats name it game played the campaign for up to 4 hours and then hit the missing prisoners bug that has never been fixed when you rescue the prisoners and get the letter do not move your prisoners off the boat as you will never get them back and hence cant proceed with the next bit of the mission its annoying this was never fixed as it meant i had to restart i cant support this company greedy wankers raptor love the videos man great work i started the campaign and im loving the game so far but i just cant seem to stay out of the negative when it comes to my income vs my expenses am i doing something wrong maybe expanding too fast for some reason everyones join button leads me to your channel just got the game and am able to blow up the fish but it is not allowing me to pick them up what this game really needs for a dlc especially considering its an ubisoft game is a jack the rippersherlock holmes story line this is my first time watching him build a city my ocd is driving me crazy lol there seems to be little rhyme or reason on where he puts farms or buildings maybe thats just me i am still watching but i have to keep reminding myself hes doing this to build a city as fast as possible and not for aesthetics is this game on steam oh raptor i wouldnt be so brazen with working conditions after all osha can tear you a new one almost as effectively as irs he always tells me no warehouse within reach ive even done everything like you to rule out a mistake this is quenching my savage thirst for the settlers remake i have scoured youtube for every bit of footage on the new one and now that i have run that dry i am bingeing anno in preparation thank you for your videos raptor d ino lmaoo the will of d this is such a cool ass game 801 raptor oh no i was right just started watching and this is a great piece of work looking forward to seeing the rest of the walkthrough for raptoria maam do i look like i have osha qualifications i laughed so hard the fire alarm went off wow beautiful game read description two a day awesome how did i magically get wood like thattheres a few proven ways just a funny fact dynamite fishing actually doesnt give a burned smell much more fun than tropico hmmm i dont think the game will be worth buying after all im going to swear that is the dumbest dumb butt thing i ever heard raptor 2019 idk why everyone wants this game so bad its just a stupid building tycoon no different than tropico and sim city im only new to this series and game ive been watching this video before i buy it i cant wait to have a go its possible to late but when you look at your hud display you see the tool symbol and the ship symbol after that you have the destruction symbol and right next to it is the upgrade symbol left click and drag for multiple upgrades i would 99 of viewers dont show their love leave a like to support us but did you even pay attention before exploring the mine about what she was saying after 20 minutes of gameplay of never seeing this game before i have decided i need this in my life what a beautiful city while flying through smoke smog and toxic air very epic read the description now wondering what map seed you used flipped over from the sandbox series because just like the duff beer commercial i just cant get enough ima call it pub g yeah thats right made me chuckle a lil ugh cant stand the pc lagging this is so fun to watch me frick court imprison this man for life bro my ocdc is broken if im watching this i hate the uncle he is a jerk hello youtube guy thomas ticker t n t loving your sense of humor new sub the will of d not alot of people liked this video but it would be a dear if you could make more of these videos this game looks great and i will buy one warehouse to 2 maximum 3 production facility types build the houses 4 in a square surrounded by roads be careful at the fire station market and leisure bar coverage 1545 how did i just magically get wood like that some select raptor reading material perhaps 1936 haha pubg hey it can be pub goode since your in game characters surname is goode im glad you named your flagship raptoria remember all raptorians by the victories we had p 4337 that music bro is the music from the witcher iii which is amazing thing because its my favourite soundtrack from that game is anyone having issues where none of the speech audio is playing correctly for them can i have a shout out please i love your videos hi raptor hi raptor i think you might have successfully helped ubisoft steam sell a copy of anno 1800 im so so on the verge of actually preordering via steam one final nudge maybe p haha anyway great playthrough on live today hi raptor great livestream and cant wait until more campaign comes out hi raptor thanks for stream im gonna call it pub g me blows air through nose 145 alright uhhhh lets pick somebody epic ignores the man with the fucking iron cross picks some homeless chap instead wtf anno campaigns are basically tutorials for sandbox modes 232 advanced is probably the real normal relocation should have a cost 1400 mr ino urban planner 2500 huddled masses yearning to breathe free 4433 choices we need a raptorian anthem stat play more please or ill kill you just kidding you should pay attention to the time it takes to produce goods so you can have the correct ratio of production buildings great series as always the mechanic that has you look for rioters in your rivals city and click on them to join you is so weak why would you even have that in this type of game feels more a mobile f2p mechanic than a strategycity builder mechanic wait it is here as a startup hint trading with sir archibald at the start can get you lots of bricks and planks its a small cost for the immediate need great commentary and excellent city planning keep it up yay new ditch island story mode looks fantastic i cant wait to see more sadly i only own macintosh so im playing through you raptor we are all still waiting for the boom much love from finland how the heck did you get the game today already d im jelly edvard is a communist fulls scale invasion time i still maintain that the warrant would be an awesome name for a ship of the line i have the perfect name for one of your flagships nebuchadnezzar by the way i really like the you make your videosbut in your new series i think your houses are a little to close to the shore in this area i would built more industrial buildings just saying edvard sounds like youtube twitter and fb rolled into one cannot wait for more awesome im glad you kept playing this game i just binge watched nearly 4 hours of your beta play through glad i found your channel and subbed hey raptor love your videos hate when they end i came across your videos about a month ago and been hooked on them since hope you have a great day cant wait till the next one thanks for making my day damn i love the way you play making jokes while also taking the story and game seriously the full game is out now yeaahhhh puts notification on yt back on for raptor by the way keralis stole your eggndham island name i think this upload was meant to be tomorrow because he keeps repeating that the game released today it releases tomorrow also seeing him upgrading houses one by one hurts my heart for people that didnt play the beta use the icon next to the hammer demolition hammer to mass build blueprints or to mass upgrade houses to workers artists etc i think using the upgrade button on the hud can allow you to build blueprints all at once by dragging this was my first annocity builder game unless aoe counts and i absolutely fell in love with it actually debating for the first time to pay full price for a game fullll release im so excited thxxxxx i want moooure

doesnt he build more firehouse hey keralis how do you zoom in so close to the road a game just like civ5 or me not very interested but its just industrial era because its anno 1800 me oh okay but i have so many city builder games keralis ladies and gentleman this is first person mode me shut up and take my money i love that you get so lost in the detail i am afraid that if i were to play id lose track of the gameplay and just stare at the art i wish they added this to frostpunk pls in future episode s pls do first person mode during a naval battle with lots of ships pls pls thank you i love the smell of you 210 pedophily lv 100 even though i only play first person shooters this game is amazing and imo the game of the year the soundtrack the details the graphics btw what kind of graphics preset do you use 1303 those chairs remind me of the meme about a guy sitting at a chair in a burning house going this is fine great series im pretty new to anno but i love it i think your problem is storage as ive seen other youtubers have more pigs with a lot fewer farms build a massive depot yard on one side of your island where you dont have your harbour am arabic this chanel is very good lol take my soap dont drop it tho said to eli whos a prison warden wtf is it with this guy talking barely cant understand anything wtf its like hes starting a sentence and i do understand it and then in the middle of the sentence he starts blabbering fast as fuck and indistinctly as fuck can somebody pls explain ps sounds like hes speaking for 3 years old jesus man whats wrong with you keralis what a waste of space bente i dont wanna hear that from you lol i love listening to your commentary the amount of detail in this game when in first person view is staggering i think shes either saying i love the smell of cheese or i love the smell of trees hit the enter button in first person mode for a surprise your city looks awesome mine looks like up side down 2319 did you say kielbasa in polish language wow im proud of you dont get enough i like it i like when stop and watch the details i lovve it keralis is the bob ross of gaming those character models look straight outta empire earth what is your system specification 200 ballon pop keralis wanter of popping of balloons i cant believe you missed it you could switch a mill for a bakery to match production timers you built 645 instead of 636 i always loved your series it has a very relaxing vibe it is very therapeutic for me i was going to buy this game but epic store stealing my favorite games again epic store has saved me like 200 but i miss wanting to play this and other games on steam i think im addicted cant get enough of this game give me more more loving anno 1800 but what happened to city skylines awesome job with the commentary and developing ahead ie not cuddling each island sweet i told you in the comment last video and now i see this as a title p not sure if a bunch of others also told you but its great youv read the comments and showed it to people haha great work as always love the street vieuw with animations its realy nice waiting for number 4 can you go first person in a ship that would be cool in combat has anyone ever told you that you sound like a khajiit you sound like a khajiit cities skylinessss ok soo that guys said your idiot maybe need to reminder him hows captain over here soo distroy his office or cut his salary muhahahhaha i am shocked about the big kontrast between the beauty of the buildings and the uglyness of the people please come back soon try to swim in the first person whats your graphics settings the models look strange haha why cant up upload more content haha no take your time i can see how much work goes into these videos first person in this game is soo amazing cant wait for the next episode keralis i bought the game what is the seed you are using keralis ok mate i need a suggestion considering you played both anno 1800 and tropico if you sould have just 60 to spend which one would you buy i played all previous anno except for 2205 that was terrible and i enjoyed them but i never played tropico so where do i put my bucks d keralis you forgot about that other island you made do the game allow you to turn first person mode in the ships is anyone having issues where none of the speech audio is playing correctly for them yo keralis awesome stuff man thanks for the uploads if you make the big warships as you did in your closed beta you can attack other islands right when you destroy their harbor you get the option to take the island or to get shares with the shares you will at least i thought get money from their income perhaps and easy peasy lemon squeezy way to make extra gold cheers j keralis i am not your uncle keralis burns their houses i think she says june not you im debating if i should buy tropic or anno 1800 reply with some tips please keralis the episode before wish there was a first person mode keralis on episode 3 ok this is epic feel you brought too much sausages could of put alcohol up for diplomacy since i think schnaps gives a diplo bonus and 50 sausage is a lot of extra rations the crate for crafting could of been nice too i imagine but in general no one seems to quite have a solid grasp on expeditions yet and the first one seems forgiving she is saying i love the smell of due in the morning not you lol great game the best anno videos and best game appreciation keralis i love the first person such an amazing game ubisoftall i want now is do more anno 1800 videos in addicted to it actually putting trees and the like in between crops is of great benefit to the crops and for pest control what a player you do need 8 steel for the trading post so technically you didnt bring enough on your flagship however youre provided with a free clipper when you reach the new world and it has materials for a trading post in it so youre good the detail in this game is amazing i like those little details that make everything so much more interesting rip farming simulator 19 because keralis is not going to play it anymore developers must introduce realistic physics to this game wind for example must affect everything first view mode is amazing addition to this beautiful game they should make it look like battlefield and maybe even incorporate battle mode as well its like you build your city you do trades and economy and first person battles as well wheres cities skylines how do you do the firstperson mode well i guess im late i was coming here to tell you about the first person view i like the way you play it you actually try to make your city beautiful and looks good i wish i could mod the first person people like spawn in betterlooking models whenwhere you go first person and keep the low poly everywhere you are not i love it yo keralis i hope that you can read my comment today i was just wondering if you can still play minecraft tutorials like if you guys agree keralis ive been following you for a short time and im having a great time with you content though i think you mistake what the lady says she doesnt say i love the smell of you she says i love the smell of dew very similar phonema huge hug and love by the way im also a great lover of grids becouse i am from barcelona kepp up the great work the series are addictive where is cities skylines im new to anno and i didnt get to play the open beta for too long so how does the income system actually work how do i increase income other than trade what happened to cities skylines season 4 also sorry cool tip 2 brick roads expand the range of public buildings ie market pubs keralis you have to add more green space between houses to reduce fire risk thats why you have so many fires keralis cool tip in the bottom right of the building select ui bottom middle of screen you can switch to blooprint mode so you can plan layouts without spending anything youre forgetting something the lady in tradeunion that lets bakeries make goods straight from the grain no mill needed lol i also think of hitman every time i hear ave maria keralis claims to be a nerd its okay keralis arent we all nerds the 5th bakery hurts to my very core i really loved the anno 2205 series i hope you can do another gameplay on another level and different land how many pig farms should we build keralis yes what about the second island any plans to develop them in parallel get that economy going man keralis if you enjoyed the old hitman games itd be awesome to see you try out the new ones ive heard you mention the series here and there in some videos keralis what game do you like more tropico 6 or anno 1800 i want your advice because i am thinking of geting one is tgere an option for daynight cycle i love how organized you are i also consider the design when playing simulation games like this however i am so frustrated with how road works and asymmetry in some games i tried shiftcontrolr in real life but i wasnt in first person mode i wonder why i really dont believe its because im already in it woow i absolutly love this game i totally nearding out just like you too for just looking you play it love how u always wanna make sth beautiful even though ur low on cash 131 did you see the man making the trinity with his hands and then praying while sitting in front of a grave stone the details in this game are truly amazing bought the game yesterday looking forward to playing it starting tonight 1335 brave french firefighter putting out the notre dame fire colourized great content does the notification youve gained an influence bonus help you with bribes and flattery between the other players nothing legal about soap ummm can you upload more cities skylines keralis always thinks that were not going to be ok with any of his changes i say go ahead man you know whats up how did i miss this i need cities skylines ive seen others play this game without grids and the amount of wasted space is phenomenal i agree with you keralis grids are life and roads roads for days ideas for gunboat names the pocketknife or the switchblade sounds more tough than dorothy love this gameplays bud so hyped for the next one congrats with the awesome work you are doing here can you pick up those apples from the trees you are putting as parks i see on steam today i cant buy it so it is going to be a game changer for me it seems loved the episode ty im stuck on a grave keralis 2019 the lady is an itemjust like it was in the good ol times rip notredame a gabbin sp means trinkets of one or many or just things is that necessery that many same work buildings srry for my bad english gubbins which is what the guy said at around 1110 basically just means stuff nowadays in my personal experience its mostly used when you are joking around with people and even then not that often like a few years ago i was looking for some stuff and said to a friend hold up just rummaging through some gubbins i tell ya the english language is dumb you are not alone thinking about hitman whenever you heard ave maria keralis you shuld do rimworld series again but with some extremly hard mods wonder how long it will take him to realise one of the bakerys is facing the other way yes i love this series and couldnt wait for an upload thanks keralis what kind of map is it i wish this game was available on mac love to watch this game but i dont like to play it as i hate micromanagement in games rip paris roof of notre dame burned down built in the 1800 i really wish they could remaster anno 1701 the game had a lot potential but they held back due to technological limitations at the time muy everyday life i was actually never so excited for a video in my entire gruesome life cities skylines omg 2 episode in 1 day we love you keralis yeah new anno vid love this game 2 keralis videos on 1 day what a treat we get keralis the master gamercaptain aright imma gonna be the good guy now 5 minutes later civilians start mass riots revolutions and war can you bring back ylands pleas great video as usual hope you upload anno gameplay more often we want city skyline please first person o best anno video till date imo keep up the great upload schedule please really makes my day thank you very much you are mean to your enemies but also a very good player and i just love it wow keralis you suprised me with another video i hope you have a great day because i sure will the uploads 26 likes and 12 views youtube is high again double upload i love it thanks keralis awesome game keralis of anno people woo hoo ad im first 100 i be waiting for this o d 3 first person is magical enjoy everyone smack the like button and see you in the next episode not on steam so im out i think you may be over building fire depts and warehouses there are timers which can help determine how many buildings needed to optimize the production chain you may know this already but thought i would share just in case is there a reason youre way overbuilding warehouses ive only watched katherine of skys excellent videos on the game so maybe you have a great reason but warehouses can handle two carts before needing to be upgraded thus shouldnt each warehouse be able to handle 2 factories isnt it better to upgrade each one to handle 3 carts than spam warehouses all over the place thats probably why youre having so much of a worker shortage and planks one suggestion though the positive structures have a radius around them of what they cover thus youre much better off building them in the middle than like you did with the marketplace where its at the end i will wait for this game to be available on steam again have a friend that had his sons account hacked on epic so staying away from that thing how do you get support form ubisoftwhat must you do chill game this fucking thing is stressful but fun af sponsered by ubisoft ubi paid you to cuss on an advertising video awesome youre a cuck you should play anno 2070 so its an aoe rip off nice great review i just bought anno 2205 as my first anno ever and i really enjoy it its on e3 sale atm so if anyone considers buying it if ubisoft is watching i want them to know that im only aware of this game because of this video so they should definitely pay you to make more i just wish these games ran higher than 20fps it really strains my eyes and end up not wanting to play at least i wont feel bad pirating it because its an epic exclusive dude we cant trust that what youre saying is true you obviously cant say anything negative even if you think the game sucks this is basically a disingenuous propaganda piece amazing what can be done simulated because in reality thered be in fighting and a need for a system of law which if left unchecked gets taken over by people who wish ill will on others for the sake of leaving your civilization open to getting invaded and occupied replacing or removing the civilization people like having another person or other people do their bidding especially without any worry of revolts as with good management and lets face it people who like taking advantage of others typically dont take the time to stratigize a good game for relax is farm together so this is basically banished 20 i can dig it man finally a game for honesty about being sponsored i was looking into it but wanted a decent review so may just get it you should give rimworld a try all kinds of fun to be had what causes defeat in campain id totally dive into this game oh wait its 60 it can go fk itself maybe itll have a decent sale during the summer saw this a while ago and never really looked at it looks like ill have to now do darkfall rise of agon sandbox pvp mmo great review definitely putting it on the wish list thank for the review im so sad i missed out on buying it on steam i want it but its so dang expensive this is video advertisment new level of ad gg may i know what software you use to edit this video i would love to watch a lazypeon playthru of this game i miss the option to build curved roads angeled houses etc everything is in squares and feel kinda like a 90s game tbh other than that im having some fun with it i loved anno 1404 if only i could afford anno 1800 you know you must say the video is sponsored in the beginning of the video itself and not a small hidden sentence in the description i hate ubisoft as a company anno 2205 was awful anno 1800 is bringing soul back into the series because of it ill probably pick it up played earlier annogames which i though suffered from too small worlds and islands nice to see you play a city builder for a change d 15hrs of game time 630min video this seems like an upgrade to caesar 4 looking for to playing it fun fact in spanish anno means asshole im buying this game because of this video cheers mate since ubisoft is my favourite company for making games i love how they beef up all of their games since the launch of assassins creed origins you just named that black guy thelazypeon lol my favorite chill game is lazypeon get angry on bad mmos makes me feelsgoodman xd it is interesting that a lot of the things you enthusiastically speak about are present in every game of the series and actually in every city bilder for that matter i do not know if it is your lack of experience with this sort of games or you wanted to appeal to the people that have not tried this type of game before i have been really excited for this but so disappointed that ubisoft will only be selling on epic games steam preorder is available up until release date but will then be removed to be expected from ubisoft however peon try frostpunk its increadible strategy game its such a good game game is based on people in england and theres nucelar winter storming so you have to build your city keep everyone warm save people from the snow storms and stuff like that its really good game are you not going to berate them and harass them for evil epic store exclusive that is the hip thing to do now if you just do it you will get more view from steam trained dogs and make more money from the video yeah do all types of games this is what i want to see lets be honest here sometimes you take it up the ass i love anno games but the ai always cheat like heck chill music chill reviewfirst impressions chill game looks looks good to me looking forward to pirating this this seems very nice im feeling to buy it tbh the only thing that pisses me off in this game is when your citizens get sick a house explodes and then the press is like look guy lets show this to the public like bruh it just fucking happened chill also the pirates run away so much probably my least favorite part of the game as fun as this game looks anno 2070 and anno 2205 have a lot of paid dlc so i wouldnt expect this one to be any different the anno games have always been some of my favorites tropico is another good chill game is there an end to the game or is a never ending type of game seems like a longer more visual version of civ on epic store so not gonna buy it looks pretty polished the 1800 beta is great i wanted to play this but they are pulling it from steam and i was planning on getting it after the pull date shame its an epic exclusive anno series are very well made sales of anno 1800 will be discontinued on steam after april 16th due to a publisher decision to make the game exclusive to another pc store this is on steams store page by the way this looks fantastic and i had no idea about open beta thank you both i used to play an old version of this game on a nintendo dsi this is quite nostalgic hahaha mine anno and tropico another promising game i will probably never play exclusivity is cancer looks boring as fuck lol i just tried this last night omg i lost 8 hrs in like an instant so it seemed thats a nope for me too much times gonna be wasted i loved caesar pc game series with caesar 2 and 3 being my favorites anno reminds me alot of these games once upon a time this kind of games where the cornerstone of pc gaming peon have you seen outward yet so this game is similar to civilization but i guess there is no turns in anno 1800 loving the footage of building trees around an empty zoo at 213 youre meant to expand it with enclosures to put animals in exclusive too epic games store and uses drm denuvo wouldnt put a buck into it if you want this game on steam ya better buy it quick its being taken off of steam and moved to epic games eh next i hate that this is happening anno went epic store exclusive so fuck them your people are starving this sentence still haunts me in my dreams graphics look awesome saved the video for later i may buy it too is it an online or offline game its been too long since i played a chill city builder game should i try civilization anno cities skylines tropico 6 or anything else i know its sponsored but not a single bad remark about the game is it truly that good thats the normal fps the animations dont look smooth at all is that an artistic choice or performance issues because if you cant run it smoothly no way in hell will i be able to this game has since anno 1404 changed to only city building where it had a bit of sea and land combat now the combat cannot reach land anymore so you will have fun till a certain time but at one point you will feel the need to attack your neighbour and you can not you will feel no purpose to be better than your neighbour if you cant even defeat himit is such a stupid design flaw and the whole anno community has begged for this feature to return but the developers refuse this is not a typical commercial game so youll need your comunity to support you and right now it doesnt dont buy this game if you like action while city building looks fun but not 50 fun so its anno xd nice i cant download it do u need to buy it first is it like civ in real time if so im sold pls make a video off wynncraft minecraft mmorpg server tried the game because of your suggestion and wow what a game i will be buying after beta what about the total war series most likely mtx will push its way through this game is 60 euro on steam and is not multiplayer you can just waith 7 to 14 days and you can download it for free you will not lose 60 euro and you will play itfor free epic exclusive no thanks stil the same anno like the ancient ones like anno 1503 sad theyre going to take it off of steam dude thx for telling me about the beta i love this game man its exacly like you said addictive af not going to be sold on steam after the 16th im actually very happy to see games going to other launchers for cheap as a massive anno fan im extremely disappointed with this game 1404 and 2070 remain far better than the new 2 i dont think he is really credible he clearly was off in astellia as someone who has played it since launch he was clueless on what to do hold on a sponsored video which was actually pleasant to watch peon youve done it youve done a thing which many youtubers do shit but youve done really well well done you ever play banished congrats on the ubisoft sponsor thats rad idk seems like civ or total war would be more entertaining so what are the down sides sadly too many no s for me fe epicstore timed exclusive and denuvo im not much for piracy and given my backlog of games ill either wait it out or skip it entirely still it looks very good and given that ive been a sucker for the anno franchise since 1602 this whole situation does make me a little sad i have been looking for a decent city builder since caesar 3 i think the might be it im not happy that sponsorship means zero indepth insight on mechanics music and graphics hey peon what software do you use for your editing great video peon where is the free weekend i cant find it still playing anno 1404 venice do a lets playseries and ill be here looks awesome if this game had pvp i would be all about it its good but not for 60euro constant music in the background is distracting never knew there is such a game watched your video tried open beta and now preordering great game for chillin i love city building games like this thank you for bringing it to my attention this game has combat against other cities too its really good i pre ordered on steam after trying the open beta looks good ill buy it when its not on epic peon this vid just made my dad a gamer he is so hyped for this game my dad be a old time og and i can not belive my eyes that he is so looking forward to this game i try to show him mmos or rts but it seems he wants a city builder and then we talked about anno series during breakfast wow very special when your dad likes something that you do its good bonding epic spyware store exclusive not interested sellout it looks like new port royale does anyone else remember this game from 2002 great news thanks for letting me know about this game cant wait for it definitely going to buy it superb video peon main building map looks like banished which is genius hey glad to see you reviewing different genres with mmos being so trash its nice to see your videos popping regardless sponsored by epic actually new peon video this is what aaa looks like now major publisheraaa game i usually dont play this kind of games but your video actually made me wanna try it awesome job peon bropls play sekiro this game really shines when you are playing it with a friend on a weekend i played a lot of managing games and would like to try this one but also i would like to buy it after it release in the platform where it was announced check what other people think about the game after it releases and have no trouble on waiting a year see you later anno cheers peon in the beta now and enjoying it i can see this replacing the civ genre this sounds real familiar to pharoahbase gameplay is kinda the samebut this seems alot more fun looks like a aaa nonpost apocalyptic version of frostpunk will probably give this a try i love it gonna wait till release fully and btw dawn of man also a building simulation and micro management you can try that out where do i download it from the 12th to the 14th sure must feel really damn good to play something that isnt a mediocre competitive online game or an amateurishly made mmo for once but rather a real and complete video game hm you should review marvel future fight amazing game its mobil but can download on pc 335 wtf is wrong with this guy cooky cutter every other city sim ive ever seen no thanks all the anti consumer practices in the world find the game and all in there good for you for getting sponsored you deserve it man are you going to do outward ubisoft all i have to know about this game and the fake i like the game and those are my true feelings video this is my type of game i would definitely attack others make them my slaves and conquer the world yeah this game is not my bag but thnx you peon have you tried satisfactory this is just civ if u want something more relaxing play sekiro the anno series is one of my favourite series of games anno 2205 is probably the best game in the series that being said anno 1800 is a very fun game to play as well i played the closed beta back in january of this year i pumped almost 30 hour into it and i was totally addicted i cant wait to play the finished game i found your comments on this game to be very fair and hopefully people will agree with me on this i suggest to anyone who hasnt played this game series before to actually try it at least for a couple of hours you might find yourself playing more than just a couple of hours though thank you for the amazing video as always d ive been watching your videos for a long time and this is the first time commenting ive played the past anno games didnt even know they are going to release a new one this game looked right up my alley and then i looked it up on steam to find this shit notice sales of anno 1800 will be discontinued on steam after april 16th due to a publisher decision to make the game exclusive to another pc store the publisher has assured us that all prior sales of the game on steam will be fulfilled on steam and steam owners will be able to access the game and any future updates or dlc through steam we apologize to steam customers that were expecting it to be available for sale after the april 16th release date after watching your video i just had to try it sim city watch out i bought the collectors edition it was so fun def a game like you said where i could soak hours in it and not even realize it even has warfare never got that far but im sure its fun and there is multiplayer why does your city reminds me of france befor the revolution lol sadly i tried to get into it but i get to the download screen and nothing happens still love your vids man i love those kind of games like planet coaster i just hope they choose the price tag wisely because i dont have another 70 cad for a game do a lets play sponsored check hyperbolic title check anti consumer publisher ubisoft check anti consumer exclusive poaching just before release epic exclusive after selling on steam check what happened to pros and cons sponsored epicubi game has only positives not even a tiny little nitpick not the slightest tiny little insignificant thing that isnt glowingly perfect really i get it you need to make money we all do and we all like more money but sheesh at least pretend youre not just straight selling out you dont even need to agree with me you can even be ubiepic fans but watch the video and honestly ask yourself if this doesnt come off as tldr sponsored game is best game ever 1010 more chill game content please you should review outward ive been looking at anno 1800 for a while thanks for reviewing to help make my decision to buy im playing the open beta right now and you were spot on as usual thanks for all you hard work on this channel hey peon thanks for another wonderful vid i love your mmo vids but im glad you have branched out to other genres always great to hear your voice feel different video based on games your sponsored by not in a good different a fake different my only question is that later on will microtransactions be necessary to progress ubisoft scares me now it looks like an amazingggg game but you never know nowadays should be noted ubisoft is pulling the title from steam on its release day so you can only purchase this on steam as a preorder it will be an epic games store exclusive if you prefer steam check out their last title anno 1404 dawn of discovery ive played many hours of that and highly recommended it im getting age of empires meets civ rev vibes from this game and i need it in my life good to see peon trying other games than mmos love the consistant uploads is the music in this video also from the game becaus it sound amazing played the other annos on steam not going to be touching this one tho since ubisoft decided to move it to the epic store on release and im not falling for the preorder trap i love this game i just played the beta for 34 hours and the tutorial told me to get some coffeei thought how nice is thisin no other pc game the tutorial was concerned about my well being lol but i have a serious question i am allways losing money what am i doing wrong am i expanding to quick my total revenue is allways negative dude please do a playthrough of sukiro your dark souls playthroughs was one of my fav series you did watched all of them like 4 times lol this looks great mate i have so much faith in anything you review his favourite chill game he says sunk 15 hours into it over 2 days this looks like just what i need at the moment a peaceful low stress solo experience dling the beta now used to play ceaser 3 this is very similar peon please play albion online it is free now and the recent updates are nice i am loving it pass on that epic exclusive crap theres no info about sponsored video an error or you didnt get money or kinda reminds me of good old anno 1503 i did not have any clue about this game at all sooo thanks i think im gonna pick this one up f after playing anno 1701 for many hours you cant image how i felt when i saw 1800 for the first time p i am a big fun of mmos too but i think this game here is going to be amazing so you can have fake media to crowd control as in real life interesting did you get the game through epic games or ubi launcher if you like this game i suggest you take a look at cliff empire its very complex futuristic city sim does it have multiplayer this is where rts games shineif its another offline city building game then not even going to give it a chance im going to be that guy and mention the developers choice to switch to epic store that doesnt bother everyone but just know some people are not fans of that store i personally prefer steam but everyone has the own preference peon i think you need more schnapps hey man i know you did a first impressions 3 years ago on this game but albion online just became free to play and received a large influx of new players i am new to the game and am incredibly hooked they added some important features any chance you would consider doing a follow up video on it i think it would be great if you could compare and contrast the differences its just a shame it will only be available on the epic store after release game is going to be removed from steam so fuck this game not playing it peon covering my favorite game franchise since childhood my life is complete now anno and chill does not collide at all with my inner colonist urge sounds cool but its a ubisoft title so how aggressive are the micro transactions too bad itll be an epic gays exclusive so i wont be buying itscrew ubisoft i dont like epic exclusivity the game itself is so good that i may not care in the end anno is a good game series with a long history i remember the first game 1602 at the end of the 90s epic exclusive shit no available on steam hmmm i really really enjoy this games since anno 1503 only hope bugisoft fix the save problem we had in the anno 1404 please put this together with an mmo and you get chronicles of elyria great short video also no mans sky creative mode or frostpunk are my go to therapeutic games just downloaded this beta last night and excited to get into it this weekend thought it was good till you said you were sponsored thanks for covering this game have been looking for something relaxing to play too tired after work and school lately to play anything high energy so i will definitely try this out i really loved anno 2070 anno 2205 dumbed down several systems of the game i hope this one is more complex i like it so far one thing that puzzles me is that everyone hates on anno 2205 but everyone likes anno 1800 and they are essentially the same game they are both great and i recommend both for the same reasons looks fun but its a ubisoft game so the world of gaming is getting smaller and smaller too bad its only on the epic store good guy anno 1800 comes out after got starts so its easier to wait between the episodes but civilization exists i will definitely be buying this when i can afford to later this month i love previous anno games and this one looks great too do a lets play of this man only 15 hr in 2 days lol so far the campaign is great cant wait to see the rest of it i love the anno franchise ill certainly buy anno 1800 thanks for the video peon awesome as always lmao at these people just rushing to hate on the epic store okay you can get the game from the ubisoft store if you want and in case you cant hear or is too stupid to watch the video this was sponsored by ubisoft the publisher epic games store did not ever heard steam sponsor a video of a game launched in their platform yeah no i still dont get why people hate competition so much its like every time a new br game comes out its touted as the fortnite killer and when epic decided to sell other games on their store suddenly theyre devil incarnate i mean monopoly aint cute the main reason people are so mad at the store is because they cant be bothered to have another login account also just a psa for everyone who is interested and intends to play through steam the game gets released on steam on apr 16th but will be discontinuedon the steam store the day after apr 17th game will be sold on another pc store after that however according to publishers any steam owners will still be able to access the game and any future updates or dlcs great video but the game is going epic exclusive upon release im out good call expanding the scope of your channel most mmos in developmentthat lotr one the mtg one pantheon that one by amazon camelot etc are still like 2 years away did your bitch ass get it on epic store i hope not great to hear publishers reached out to you youre always fair when it comes to assessing games and you deserve success great to hear the games good i was really hoping it would be the game looks great i can t wait to release to play it too definitely buying it i like the old anno games so this one is definitely already in my to buy list you actually mentioned what i like about the game most its so rewarding and theres almost no down time i can sink hours in the game and progress as slow as i want actually looks pretty decent also note if you want it on steam buy it now after release it will be an epic store exclusive youll need the uplay launcher either way ive played an older version of this game and it seems mostly the same which is good i guess you should really mention that its going to be an epicuplay exclusive after april 16th people should rush to preorder on steam if they want a decent platform so basically a finished version of banished v 100 getting this ya ill get it when its on steam the shitty epic exclusivity though hey this looks pretty gre oops 60 and its about to be an epic exclusive no thanks way to work for epic games peon just bought this game and holy shit is it good edit im just kidding im too broke the game costs 60 euro keep it coming i remember anno on the nds 151 wow random finnish words appears on the screen just means fish head but how and why decent game kinda reminds me of pharaoh by sierra isnt it as stressful as banished or tropico franchise i am really excited for anno 1800 the anno series is one of my favorite franchises since my childhood i just hope the new game is not too much like the last anno game anno 2205 was so different because they changed core mechanics it looks like the went back to their roots with this game though the problem with ubisoft is how they market their games after this month this game is going to go on sale for around 30 dollars such as assassins creed odyssey never buying a ubisoft game on release ever again plus 60 dollars is too much for a city builder anyways been waiting long for this game d hey man ty for this video i didnt know there was a beta going on minecraft is my chill game 10h of captured material 6 minutes video tried in alpha amazing game surprised you covered this but glad you did preordered the game already 3 great video peon thx for the heads up on the beta gonna check this out with the wife today a youtuber that truly enjoyed a product he was paid to review that is truly shocking finnaly this looks excellent ive been looking forward to this one thanks mate cant wait for the 2020 release singleplayer yikes everyone needs their chill game mine has been civ for years i plan on giving this one a try for sure i guess frostpunk is not chill enough for you well it is stressful as fuck and its amazing you should give it a shot can sponsored youtubers critique the advertised product i mean this is not the peon we all know other sponsored videos in general are always about shit products yet youtubers have to complement the product like crazy i know they are being payed and that is part of the job but i dont know really does it run through mobile too man your a chill guy and we all know the mmo genre has less and less content to make something out of play stuff that you like and most of us will follow you keep it up man yay peon love this lol so your solution was social segregation i remember playinng anno on browser was fun even with the wait to build mechanichs or speed it with gems still was quite fun now that its a game on its on own cry me a river and give me that shit i only play mmos pay the newspaper to write only good for you reminds me of on our newspaper looks like this never change id love to see a video about your backstory by the way tis a shame my laptop cant run this anno 1404 venice is still my favorite in the series the new features added dont seem to warrant a full price purchase from me this series in general has gone the way of tropico where they release full cost installments without changing features or presentation enough to justify it day 15 of me asking peon to play mabinogi slowly losing hope this is pretty damn amazing oooo o this game looks chill af where and when can i get it looks and sounds familiar aoe is just one that comes to mind ho hum another repeat to pass on great content greg 3 risk of rain 2 is awesome just saying notification squad form up great vid this has been asked a lot so thought i would address it you do not have to use others layouts when planning your city or production lines personally i prefer to design them myself i added them to the video because many people are not aware of the extensive and helpful wiki whats most important is that you enjoy playing the way you want to have fun a beautiful looking game is there drm free version really an anno calculator thank you soooo much i been thinking about it but was lazy to serch for it hehe can you do an anno 1800 play through very informative and straight to the point earned a like and sub great video alot of useful info never thought about checking wiki for layouts to minmax basically all i needed to know to make more efficient layouts thanks for the resource plug lol why doesnt anyone in any of these tutorials ever tell you which buttons to press ive been trying to play anno 1404yes i know its an old one but i just wanted to try it out to see if i liked this type of game please will someone tell me which button i need to press thank you for showing off the new game really enjoyed the vid xxx oh merry christmas so good to see you uncle i need to know more about trading you are amazing thanks for help d at roughly 75 hours in i still look like a total noob ive planned implemented and produced like crazy standing on 75m gold but only 15k income per minute ive seen people on 500m and 150 to 500k per minute income i played anno online few years back in the browser i played it for over a year and it was fun but i really hated the math behind it it takes away the fun in my opinion you are forced to have the important things in the middle and build everything around it that applies to both things industry and citizens the same goes for the settlers online i played it was all about a warehouse in the middle and then you had to find rectangular area which was capable of taking 2 industry buildings on the left and on the right of the warehouse and then 2 rows by 5 above and under warehouse to be the most effective as possible it forces you to utilize every little square and think too much about the effecitivity instead of simply playing the game and enjoy it this randomly came up in my recommendations i mostly know all of these by now 120 hours in but damn this is a really really good video wish i saw this when i first started 040 i like the way you say potatoes i didnt know about the wiki and ive been playing the game for a week now got it on uplay and the table helps so much thank you for this video amazing video and you seem like a very genuine person so i give you a sub though efficient i find a lot of those layouts to be terribly boring and squarerectangular legit informative and useful guide thank you for the pro work my record is lvl 12 after that im broke hahaha this video was literally gold for me i had totally missed how the trading of overstock i went from 300000 gold to 600000 under five minutes good video now if i could solve the issue with the game crashing after about 15 minutes of game play show us how you play it episode by episode thank you katteryne this was helpful furmee very helpful you got a sub from me very useful guide foranybody new to anno 1800 thank you just fucking love you for this video okay this is 2 games i play your making vids for so ive subd up keep it up i needed this i failed the campaign before i made it to the new world rip is there anyway ingame to get a more detailed breakdown of what is costing you money more than just the totals for maintenance cost or ship upkeep etc this video is awesome wish i saw it much much earlier cos then i wouldnt have been scratching my head about restarting the campaign mode that was meant to teach u things love the vid thinking about buying the game had to laugh at the anno 1800 wiki sounds like a phone call helpline number i loved your video helped me out a ton because the game is not so intuitive you are my first female gamer that i decided to subscribe on not to offend anyone but i dont see many female creators in gaming area do well on introducing games you give information concisely and in a clear manner most male creators provide energy in their speech but yours are calming and informative this vid adds a lot on my gaming experience thanks for the vid and keep up the good work very helpful you managed to clear out some stuff in a simple way tyvm aside from the quite clickbaity title thank you for the tips they were good great video answered all the questions i had about anno 1800 subbed heh first anno game looking for guides find kos back to factorio so helpful thank you for this guide ahhhhh you saved me a good tip is buying staff for the trade union i found a person that allowed you to skip the flour portion of making bread so you simply turned gain into bread thank you so much have been enjoying the game on my own but getting frustrated there isnt a proper tutorial so its been hard for me to work it all out youve explained very quickly a lot of things i didnt know very helpful d thats a helpful tip about the ratios so i can sell excess items with no hassle items that arent required for building etc copy a layout you found on youtube and build your city like this lol its more fun to creat your own layout even if you fail my capacity for recourses is 75 how did you get 125 perfect take on how to start a masterpiece game thank you what map it is baught the game yesterday thanks for sharing this video really helpful the ratio on ironcoalsteelweaponssteel beams was is a little brain destroying i have a personal distrust to people who solely use predefined layouts in anno thanks for the vid i just recently bought it on the ubisoft store i got to say its super amazing and thank you for these tips and tricks great video but i prefer a more french style for cities history creates the shape of cities no planning its not good for an optimized video game but its a more organical feel to cities nice video this is the most relaxing game series ever for me just love it really damn helpful thank you basically an anno 1800 beginners guide and asmr video at the same time consider yourself subbed great video lovely guide had no idea about the ratio one thing i hate about the game is you need influence to create ships and cannon defenses i have 15milion gold with 24k income conquered 90 of the islands in the old world 100 of the islands in the new world but i cant create anymore ships because my influence is at 200 how do i farm more influence beside increasing population thank you for these tips loving this gamemy first anno ive watched about a dozen of these guides for the game and yours is the best for quickstart and tips thank you i used your epic creator tag ty for your content two questions what kind of mouse are you using how do you tell the game to show the influence radius green lines for connectivity i am seeing nothing on my game thanks for everybodies help great tips great video thank you liked and shared so that more ppl can see it thank u for the great vid nice guide worth a mention that stone roads will increase the distance your services reach sorry no epic store for me preordered it on steam just to avoid bullshit of epic proportions xd thanks for tips tho keralis is my master i never heard of you lol also usefull when youre low on space the charcoal burner and lumberjacks can be build with overlapping working areas and stil get 100 efficiency awesomeshouldve saw this video before i saw the defeated screen on my 20k population all those hrs down the drainlol that was such a great and informative video all the little thing i didnt know which make me love this game even more thanks again the where house tip is a good one if you find youre in the red early game check your maintenance costs and the likely culprit are the upgraded wherehouses at 50 a piece excellent video thanks my city keeps going bankrupt after instilling engineers tier even though i am major pork supplier to the biggest region mine maintenance keeps hitting up to 12k great guide i like the balance of tips and video length i learned a lot thank you where are the links to production calculators strong disagree on 630 dont overproduce anything basically all items cost more to produce than you can sell them for so with your tip youre actually just burning money a few items such as steel beams actually are cheaper to buy from others than to produce yourself and you dont pollute your island by buying it from others besides that great video for beginners you absolutely saved my game i could not for the love of avocado figure out the ratios and how to earn money thank you 3 hey new to anno and i cant figure out the balance it wont stay stable for me goes up and down so much i cant make money besides selling ships to the queen is there any tips on controlling your balance ive got 26 hours in this so far and this video was still incredibly helpful thank you excellent tips one small note about overproducing to sell for gold dont get too carried away with it you still have to pay maintenance cost even if the npcs are not buying all your excess goods i find the costs of having excess industry is usually more than the income you make from the goods so i just go by make just a little more than you use with the bonus gold from selling excess being just a nice way to balance your production the exception of course being constructing ships and selling them to the crown rep npc surprisingly lucrative without a cap as far as ive seen awesome tips thank you this is my first anno game and im already doing much better on my first island thanks to your tips ive moved a bunch of stuff around and reorganized and im making money again and started a new island for farming and farmers thanks i came here because im utterly bankrupt time to start over i guess x what are you doing pretty sad this game on epic store rather than steam awesome tips thank you i found this very useful thank you i probably wont use the layouts but the information about ratios especially helps a lot not gonna lie im totally in love with her voice great tips do you have any more good stuff 808 hot damn been playing for 50hours already but never noticed the timer on the production and figuring out ratios from there really solid tip finally a good anno guide thank you really nice tips for beginners thanks the city layouts are tightly packed which is going to result in more fires also they lack any ornamental variety which is going to reduce the attractiveness of your city the attractiveness of your city will impact your ability to make money down the road hopefully as more people play the game well get better layouts that reflect these factors thanks for doing the video used your ode keep up with the great vids this is an advanced guide not a beginner by any means thanks for the video very good for new players btw the city layout you ve chosen i ve seen it too but it does not have pubs i will probably swap the police stations for pubs myself great video great guide thank you thank you so much for explaining every think i need to know before i was watching this video i was clueless will playing anno 1800 as i have never played any anno games hope you make more videos of anno 1800 had a really fun few hours on the game today in between work calls i came to a bit of a brick wall at artisan happiness because my lands were not fertile for hops or peppers i would really appreciate your insight into how to efficiently expand to other islands specifically to get stuff you cant access on your homeland because you need workers and artisans to run the beer and canned food sites i ended up having to build up a whole second city am i doing it wrong felt crazily over the top just to get what i was missing i tried buying the missing goods by setting purchase orders at my port but nothing came in it makes sense for trade to be the answer but im a bit of a build it myself person is there an efficient way to build small outpost cities quick question does using the layouts make the game less fun my first anno game so i kinda want to use the layouts but seems like thats part of learning the game they should have hired you to make a tutorial the game barely explains anything even when you have the extra information option enabled for your campaign i got a much better understanding of how anno 1800 works now thanks this tips like i playing anno 1404 again didnt play 1800 but now ill look in to it awesome thx while i like the work put in to get the city layouts available i prefer to go the trial and error mode the relocation feature will be huge for that using guides just makes it to me a paint by numbers game id rather decipher and learn the hard way then maybe after i pull hair out ill got the layout guide route anyways thanks for these uploads really appreciate them game predownloaded and now playing with anno designer making efficient farms xd nearly as fun as playing the game haha if you upgrade your streets the range of the buildings increases too great info for the starters indeed looking forward to the release tomorrow going back to the roots i will not use epic so this game is dead to me ok ok you convinced me bought the game through your link wish you all the best more content soon please thanks for the info really useful for people when starting the game keep up the good work i played the open beta i am so glad to have an anno game that feels like an anno game great guide though as far as i tested it in the open beta upgrading a warehouse does actually add 2 loading ramps its still more efficient to build a second warehouse but when space is an issue upgrading can be better this kind of made me want to get the game o great little guide you sound super professional when doing something like this very nice guide thank you very much and i hope you continue enjoying the game thank you very much for this veryhelpful guide you provide fabulous tutorials im new to pc gaming but youve taught me so much especially factorio cant wait to play this game when it goes live and watch your vids

greater raptoria ships can win the water battles but you need boots on the ground too take thee land something amiss with this game you are a good player caster keep it up anyone ever tell you that you sound a little like sal in any case ill be watching these vids to get an idea of what the game is about ive had it for a while but been too busy to actually open it up and play it until now got real keen to have a look at this on steam but couldnt find it hmm oh well loot lake from fortnite is in your map game is nice price is absolutely ridiculous this game looks sooo nice been wanting to get a pc for a while and now im definitely sold on getting one seeing this gameplay you certainly know how to keep the viewer not getting bored considering its a slow kinda paced game good stuff thank you for aesthetic planing of the town i dont believe you are raptor i just found you and you sound like wranglerstar i just found out about this game and i love these kind of games wow it looks incredible or as you would say gorgeous lol great channel i just subbed is american sees the oil in his world knock knock it the united states is coming out x box one what program do you use to record

during a sale if i remember this guy reminds me of bob ross what is your pc setup motherboard cpu memory gpu etc the host reminds me of butters is this game you play with ppls online u just gave me a new game to buy thanks didnt know that adam adam cianciarulo was so into gaming you sound like him or the other way around i need this game ive owned every age of empires and this game looks amazing would love to get this game but not on steam bro after 234 and you stumbling on moose i about pissed myself laughing and missed the next 4 minutes of video and had to rewatch it i think a few swear words here and there would improve things epic store such a shame a good game like this is exclusive to a greedy shitty company that game looks fantastic u sound like shroud ive been watching some citybuilding videos lately on youtube im really glad i found your channel more power to you geez thats a beautiful game thanks a lot enjoyed this so much made me want anno really bad bought it and then came to the realization neither of my computers will even run it did you forget to show your mouse pointer why did they decide to take this off steam should i play campaign first or just go straight to sandbox i played the series before so im not worried about learning how to play just fyi should play the campaign to know the fundamentals and basics of the new series entry just for the visual and soundtracks is a buy for me ive been looking for a series to binge and ive finally found it so pls continue lol ubisoft just bought age of empires is anyone else worried that the gameplay hasnt changed much from anno 1701 1417 its a fjord thank you for these videos it helps quite a bit this is multiplayer or story god i love the anno series never played any city builder and let me say this is the most confusing thing ever i have no clue what to do and its quite frustrating this was a great video thank you couple questions 1 do warships need weapons in their hold from your weapons factories to be able to fire or do they fire automatically once built 2 when you force build over the limit for farms do those extras add any more production to the farm or just for aesthetics thanks in advance age of mythology flashbacks gold old times lots o america right thurr the us army intensifys huehuehuehue spot on mate playing this game is like streaming a video with 1 kbs this looks amazing but im on ps4 rip so you can learn something new the plural of moose is just moose its one of those weird words will we visit the moon in this one d is it me or does this guy sound like jeff goldblumloving it excellent gameplay good sir thank you sir this is the gameplay i needed game looks kinda awesome is this game hard never really played city building games and upon seeing this game play im considering trying buying anno 1800 tried the beta its amazing this game gave me major flashbacks to the much older game 1602 ad theme song intensifies i might have to pick this up when it comes out this is my first time hearing about this game two minutes watching this video i know im buying this game just love this type of city building game to be specific this takes place in the 1890s just found your channel im new to subscribe enjoying anno 1800 though how much is the game love the vid subbed so cheerful and happy brightens up my world am i the only one chuckling at the sausage factory the game looks stunning just played the open beta wow this game is good building houses or any structure should take longer this game has an amazing detail and animation but they messed up the building animation which is very instant great video thankyou us army intensifies lul what are the pc requirements i am enjoying this so much cant wait to play thanks what was the crack near the beginning about the us army pre order made thx so youre grays big brother game looks great will have to get it love the video and commentary excellent work raptor you do showcase a game extremely well does he sound like trump when trump gives his speeches its gonna look beautiful believe me annies gonna have to be dealt with beautiful base though beautiful lol imagine civvies with these graphics for graphism anno 1800 or tropico 6 finally a 3d game that looks like those well designed 2d games but instead u have zoom control and all angles i always hated that 3d games never achieved the good old perfect 2d look good that it seems this game changes that games like this are why i prefer pc gaming not many good city builders on console i got to say i was really getting into the game until you moved the camera off your coastline and panned down as your ship was leaving to explore the first time and just seeing that beautiful view and detail of the water and the coastline settled it for me as soon as i finish building my computer im buying this game cause it gorgeous and the ui is just so clean and crisp that i love it i really dont get this command and control economy in most games in reality humans have the ability to selforganize is this game like tropico looks better for sure this game is just the last anno with better graphics not even one thing new such nostalgia anno 1800 is definitively worth its money as i can tell by playing hundreds of hours in the previous annos so if you wanna play it make sure you have plenty of time cause once you dive into it you wont turn it off d 517 not anymore brother what would anno in the year 40k be like if you were a highlord in the imperium does it have army and aerial units dude whats with that intro so loud once were done here we can bag some rabbits you really butchered the princesss name didnt you 1648 we can now makeuuuh sausages the sausage age 2442 lol thats what she said or er a non binary robot i mean pfft why isnt your cursor not showing up you have a cool voice most boring game ever there are bisons in europe even today im thinking of getting this people who have played it how is it i would go on ign and stuff but im looking more of an honest opinion ubisoft lost my support i own several of their products all bought thru steam no more money from me then ubisoft i will recommend this to my entire friends list and any platform i belong too will hear this message gaming is a multibillion industry let your voice be heard and say no steamsad do you like old games you must play age of empire 2 this game looks shit did i hear oil use steam for advertisement then swap smart move wont buy for those of you who dont knowyou must prepurchase it like now on steam to play it i see a note on steam site for anno 1800 that says on launch date of april 16th the game will go to another pc storeand we all know where they mean i am triggeredmany of my games are going there im princess chang my parents sent me as an ambassadorcan i bang you for diplomatic reasons of course good video dude thx looks like the same game style from the 90s i was hoping for something fresh you can load up any of these games and theyre all he same which is boring to me help me my youtube is broken in every video i go there is no videos to scroll down couldnt tell if serious or not so its always moose p oh this game looks fantastic i wish so badly it would come to console one day just the soundtrack alone makes me want to dive into this game nothing creates more unhappiness in a city than a severe lack of sausage you sound like the news reporter from family guy and the such which sounds super smooth and your american accent is actually classy as hell haha videos good and all but the pixel three add before this video was even better oh its literally free just takes money d which anno game would you recommend for someone whos new to the series more lumber is required gorgeous game i know they have done a lot of work on aesthetics but is it me or the gameplay is lacking a bit even tho they are super beautiful they all feel the same maybe i just need to try one out this one looks more fun but 80 bucks is a bit much annie you crazy hoe d good gameplay bruh gorgeous game game looks like classic dawn of discovery cant wait for this and settlers hope settlers is back to classics as well if its not broken dont fix it i say is this a satisfying game for someone who likes tropico im looking for a lot of micromanagement finally a youtube gamer that isnt 90 autism thank you for showing the game properly we need more gamers like you because of you i want this game now ubisoft better be paying you cool remindes me of old games is this on steam i think anno finally got a great game here bit overpriced on steam im gonna wait for a sale and consider it but love the way you present this raptor been here since the mowas2 days and im never disappointed anno 1701 was my first why didnt you just trade with omara for the bricks how are you playing this game when its not even out yet its like playing tropicocivilization great rts game in 2019 i want this but my wallet says wait for steam sale this game looks sick cant wait to play it i hate waiting haha doesnt this release in april picking this up during a spring sale along with other games cant wait heh this caught my eye for a couple reasons 1 looked amazing at first glance 2 my wifes filipino the word anno ahnoh means what in tagalog i thought perhaps someone named a game what which made me say what then whats this about followed by what the hell lastly what was i thinking plural of moose is moose p 205 time to uh spread democracy whats up with all the female npcs in the game dev trying to be sjw and pc dont imagine there were too many female pirates or industrialists during that time rip endavour the game not allowing u to build a bridge acrossed the gorge waa very disapointing to me how is city skylines so ahead of everyone else when it comes to road and path building why are there no male characters anno 1800 will be my first anno and im very exited thanks for these episodes to keep me busy until april 16 i think the ship is what you called a steampowered brigantine a ship with a square sails on the foremast a latten sails on the mainmast will this come to ps4 wow i didnt realize the world was soooooo matriarchal c 1800 oh wait it wasnt so its ubisoft for revisionist gynocentric historybased games these days is it think ill pass on this one and everything by ubisoft but thanks anyway sometimes pretty just aint enough this game is gorgeous lets build another nice little neighborhood here continues to build a bunch of shacks in a line that looks like ghetto formation yeah raptor keep telling yourself its a nice neighborhood anybody living in your city lives in the hood wow this is actually a surprise seeing a game strategy game without a garbage art style is getting pretty uncommon these days colonisation is a good thing is this game like anno 1404 then im buying this game without thinking this reminds me of the good ole days of age of empires this is literally tropico 6 man this game is ugly in comparison to something like tropico lots of oilfields us army intensifies that buddy got you an instant subscribe right there so basically the same game play as all the other anno games with a 1800s reskin this guy is definitely from michigan the endeavor thats the ship that cook captained to discover the country i call home strayaaa yew this or civ this game is a lot like civ but looks a lot better will this game run with mx150 8gb after you record your narration move your audio timeline back a little bit to sync the video with you reaction to it whats this

great video thank you i would like to know if there any game like this on android any suggestions i thought this game was first out in april the music reminds me of the theme of saving private ryan

is with the delay theres no mouse pointer in this game looks good but ill wait for a price drop or sale currently 90 to buy no thanks iron clad iron clads are the battleships thats a coal engine steam boat i lived in bristol uk and when the guy at 355 said that fish pie smells gert lush i was taken aback hahahahah it is still being said to this day what an epic game really want this game but 6000 is way to much should be 30 its not a aaa first person shooter ar a fallout type game its a top down map style game way to much this game look it so similar to banished aww you bastard i came here thinking oh damn i should see if i can get this game and i can in two god damn months i played the shit out of dawn of discovery stayed up all night went to bed dreaming of farming spices especially indigo so colourful and establishing trade routes looking forward to this missed the other onesdidnt seem to be as positively reviewed as dod was may be a dumb question but can someone tell me how some people are playing the game ik it doesnt come out for a little but i see a lot of people playin any help is appreciated yall one of the best games i have ever played can you play it on playstation more modern age of empires ubisoft activate dlcbutton in a brandnew game me yohoho and a bottle full of rum wait 71 years and then you got deutschland it is just like a reboot on rise of nations cool game dude i remember playing anno on my ds xd anno 2205 future anno 1800 industrial anno 2020 world war 3its gonna happen reminds me of rise of nations along with many others nice post does that lady keep saying i love the smell of jew the german empire was around then known as the famous ottoman empire it was mostly built from the remains of the roman catholic empire it started out as the main country defending the catholic pope but the spanish empire soon got that role thanks to its superiority at sea obviously until 1588 the battle of the armada the ottoman empire still defended the pope though and had a very peaceful relationship with the spanish i miss the old anno games they were great looking forward to this one hope they drop the price some though i enjoyed dawn of discovery and played it for thousands of hours this looks an updated version of it and is already sold for me ur missing a tree by your market and its killing me is this minecraft sniff mmmm i sure love the smell of jew are you not able to put roads down diagonally or in an arch who knew ned flanders did youtube vids just kidding enjoyed rip the mobile game 3408 funny thing that the chinese empire tells you its admireable to live with the truth instead of uhediting or censoring the news we all know thats not how china rolls 521 they werent even close to it i thought the game wont be released until april 2019 how you playing it so looks like iam going to trade civ vi for anno 1800 o jaw dropping surprice anno is back 3 how important do you think the video card will be for this game im running the intel hd 520 and the minumim req is a geforce gtx 670 since when does jason sudeikis have a gaming channel i enjoyed your video but the word flotsam is not floatsam fakenews can you freaking edit the newspaper so freaking accurate they dont have a raptor for the banner this is an outrage s glad that they seem to bring back the island exploration theme back great video but i find it hard to follow when i dont see the cursor thats certainly not a walmart greeter classic raptor there are bison in the old world they are a cross between the steppe bison and the auroch wil this come to ps4 half an hour in and wondering when and if he will see through the workforce system this game reminds me of a ds game called dawn of discovery does the computer cheat in this game just like it did in the last one because in the last one the computer factions would just build late tech 5 mins into the game when it shouldnt even have any resources 2019 and still 90 degree roads i have a major problem with this schnapps is not made from potatoes schnapps is a fruit brandy vodka is what you make from potatoes did the people who made banished make this game watching on valentines day hit like if your the same next is anno 2205 the commentary really keeps my attention any coop for this game similar to 1404 i subscribed too you because what you get excited about is adorable in this video year 1800 and you get the era of agriculture facepalm i ruled a communist contury you can see the fertility of your island on the left above the minimap the game looks very nice cant wait for release it took me an half hour to remember when and why i subed im furious how come this guy is playing even before its released and i just have to watch him enjoy this beautiful game i love the piano around the 11 minute mark gotta need that huge bridge construction enabled before release hey i dont know if you heard this yet but anno is pronounced like ahno the problem with the anno games is the same as ever a tremendous lack of diversity that makes sure every game is pretty much the same stop it from being more solid and just makes it that game just cool to play every now n then however it must be said it is a lot of fun being able to micromanage your economy making sure you are making the right choices and keeping everything running smooth you will get bored tough and fast and this is your experience be it in anno 1602 2070 or whatever from one perspective it is admirable how they managed to keep what made the game good over the years but from another it is kinda a meh feeling that they never really risk it and bring another rts elements to the franchise in over 20 years since the first game came out its nice to add a litlle color to the map is putting down green trees on a green map if bob ross played videogames you got a good voice for youtube bro good luck im not sure i want another anno series on my games list after a bit they justidk wear out maybe im burned on the series so civtropico anno wish i had a pc i really wish we could see your mouse 1st time watching one of ur vids nd i love ur commentating dudekeep it up dudealso subed to u gurt lush never prouder to be from the west country oo arr us army intensifies lol 2249 i love the smell of jew isnt there meant to be a mouse cursor showing lets get this video to 500 likes also how you get to play this so early the sausage big mooses big mices meece is the correct answer raptor hand on heart are you getting paid for this being this excited over a game that is not any better than ancient classics like caesar iv or plethora or freemium mobile games seriously like every second sentence starts with what is also nice do you own equity in the company that produces this game or why does the whole video sounds like a sleezy sales pitch i generally like your videos but this is just poor this game doesnt drop until april 2019how do you have it already every time you say sausage factory idk why but it makes me laugh this game looks amazing one thing i always have though with anno is that i think its way too complicated omg if you listen vaguely you sound like ian fing malcolm my first time watching a full video of yours and i like it im so jealous i dont have a pc gaming rig would absolutely love to play this game hope you continue to make videos on this game and you got yourself a new subscriber villefraiche is french for fresh town totally apt name wouldnt you say does anno 1800 have a daynight cycle 3843 faint baldeagle screeching in the distance little tip if you are losing money the incentive to save the one you have is minimal so spend that shit as fast as possible this is a mix of civ and cities skyline that intro was stale is it just me or does anyone else remember tropico when looking at this this guy is the bob ross of gaming lol id say the ability to modify the news is a way easier joke to make about america than the presence of oil haha how much does this game cost its already 2019 but this game looks like it was delayed ffrom 2013 i am looking forward to this one despite its from unisoft it seems wuite good so far very inefficient but very eye pleasing build i guess they had livefeed spysatellites in 1800 i watched this whole thing like it was a tv show more interesting than most of the crap on tv lol so basically this game is a mix between sim city and age of empires i love the way you play yes making your city look pretty is a part of the game i cant wait for this game to come out i see you also watch biggjah videos subscribed within the first 2 minutes due to what you said about the us army xd villefraiche in english is freshtown the advantage to talk 2 language maybe even 3 were here to take your oii mean bring you some freedom and democracyyeah i meant that first time viewer great content has anyone ever suggested that your vocal demeanor resembles that of alec trebek its awesome what time of game is this is this anno 1404 with a new skin i dont know how i got here but i love it uswho said oil how much is this game wait can you get the great eastern in this game the ship on the front page the music at 530 beautiful 1002 they are all hanging outoh wait humans are here gotta stop the party im dead d i thought this game is going to be released in april when you upgrade your homes you kill off your farmers raptor theres a 1 second audio delay not sure if you have already identified thisbut it seems there is a second tab down the bottom that say workers i think you are only building farm houses and possibly not building work houses just an idea disregard this if you have sorted this out in future videos really looking forward to this games release thanks for showing a decent preview subbed guys should i buy that game love these videos keep it theyre great i keep seeing content farmer and cant help but think that would make an epic youtube channel name looks terrible compared to anno 2080 damn i wish these guys remade zeus master if olympus poseidon master of atlantis age of agriculture raptor age agriculture of i am a joke to you okay this is epic great video ive never played an anno game but i really like city builders and history this is probably something i will get sound is not synched looks like a good game though and here i am playing empre rise of middle kingdomlol you need farmer build a house you need worker upgrade the house am i the only one were the sound does not line up with the game i love the smell of jew game looks epic cant wait to play it already preordered on steam

a delay love this game and the series look forward to many more episodes where is our communist utopia bro hope youll play the empire campaign in ra3 with a buddy in coop mode this game reminds me of a mix between rise of nations and sid meiers civ heyyyyyyy pls do beamng or something fancy love the intro btw i love this series i was so confused i played this game called dawn of discovery im watching this and im like wtf this game is practically a rip off what is going on i just realized that anno and dawn of discovery is the same thing face palm 2019 and they still have square roads in the game lol thanks for diving straight in and explaining what the game is about without taking a hour to get there ive been watching this game for awhile now and debating on playing it anno 1404 and anno 2070 were and are still amazing i hope this is just as good if not better i love the fact they got back to the old system i played a lot of anno 1404 and might play this one dawn of discovery was perfection i cant wait for the sleepless nights this will give me grid of squares are we still in the 90s i am sorry your computer had run out of memories the game will now crash every 15 mins is it real time strategy i tried anno 2070 cus i really liked 1701 even though i feel it takes a lot of tries to actually get it down right just started playing 1701 again and was starting from scratch after 3 or 4 years not playing it 2070 was confusing and unintuitive to me and i just quit playing it and went back to 1701 and didnt even consider trying 2205 i hope ubisoft are gonna release a full game and not chop it into bits to sell or try and put microtransactions in it other than maybe skin packs you can choose for you or individual or all players when playing against ai you are absolutely right though it looks gorgeous and the idea of pollution that will make people ill more easily and that you cant just have every member of society be the highest class are very appealing to me just wishing i had some people to actually play these games with i feel anno are the most relaxing and chill game to play as the game by no means forces players to kill each other anyone in europe that speaks english is it computer only or is it available on console as well been a fan since anno 1602 with 1404 being my fav one by far i didnt like the futuristic ones i even skipped the last one though 1800 yes getting back to an historical setting is a very good choice from the team looks really good and thank you for this great preview this game better have continuous gameplay with warfare in it 2205s no warfare was a stupid decision please tell me 1800 has randomized maps again no curved roads the anno series numbers always add up to 9 1602 150317011404207022051800 this title is number 8 in the seriesthere will only be one more after that then its back to tetris again 1602 is the best by the time i got a computer that would allow me to play anno 1404 on 5k smoothly the game was not playable anymore no support for higher than hd systems so sad well its anno 1404 again city skylines is actually more complex in how it manages overall happiness in your city not only does it track citizen happiness but that of businesses as well it tracks things like transit time pollution not just air either type of jobs available access to services noise levels type of retail stores available and property values certain industries require educated workers resources to manufacture and places to distribute their goods or they could go out of business you must provide places to dispose of trash and the deceased as well since citizens age and retire if your city has a lot of children youll need more schools etc its actually easier to keep your citizens satisfied in anno series once you reach certain requirements food access to a tavernchurch clothes etc happiness in most anno games until requirements are met for upgrades annos challenge comes from its complex supply chain and getting the resources needed to advance your city game is gorgeous i love the fact that its going back to its roots i love the series from 1602 except that modern 2070 looking forward to this it looks very promising oh i might try this game it realised or not meh i will pick it up in 2020 when it is on sale for 7 dollars finally an open world sandbox anno game i hope in 1800 will be more war bigger maps more opponents etc war like anno 1602 ooooh i must have this one i have all the previous annos and i am a serious fan off those games will it run on the new macbook air hope they bring back the warmth and depth of the leader characters from 1404 the last few have felt cold basic and 2d 1404 they felt like people you knew by the end of it i loved 1602 when i was a kid the music was so soothing didnt play any other anno now i have heard about anno 1800 should i play it and bring back those memories is the picture quality better than in 1404 seems identical look like anno 1404its a 1404s mods they should make an anno 2007 the music at 830 is beautiful anno trivia names of all the games 9 1800 9 1404 9best of the series 2205 9 2070 9 check them out youll see add all the digits she sounds lesbian ja like well buy a 10 year old game from steam looks a lot like anno 1404 which is a good thing for my tastes as that was my favorite of the series dont personally have much to look forward to with regards to upcoming releases but this is certainly the exception cant wait to play it 044 hey sci fi was good what i loved about anno was the complex systems and they were dumbed down a bit with anno 2205 i was excited for this game until until i found out it wasnt going to add any steam punk fantasy or carry the stream lines features 2205 added ill probably play it anyway but im going to miss the trade wars looks great cant wait this game looks amazing its like anno 1404 hope the music is as good as 2070 i cant wait for this thats what anno was missing a white tiger loved 1404 i still play it to this day i also really enjoyed 2070 despite its scifi setting 2205 was a different matter altogether 2205 seemed to lose its soul it lost the intricacies that made an anno game enjoyable it became so streamlined it actually became generic and more like a mobile game it was such a shame because it really did look gorgeous if you had the hardware to run it it wasnt very well optimised im absolutely looking forward to 1800 i cant tell how excited i am about this game anno 1404 was my favorite of all and it even helped me about my depression because it was such a nice laidback game and detailsoh details about this game makes this game shine it looks perfect in my opinion they really learned from their mistakes from 2205 4 docks next to eachother looks a little goofy i dont like rts games in which you spam the same building all over the place i started with anno 1602 played all the others that came out afterwards scifi setting not incl and there is none that compare tot 1602 imo after playing 3 recent anno 140420702250 i am so fed up of the formula although it was really awesome especially the terrible annoying combat combat is the reason i quit 2250 this series need innovation to keep fans interested the coal and steel in this port go through trevor philips industries or they aint going ahhh awesome glad 1404 gets a real sequel now ive played all the anno games i quite enjoyed 2205 surprisingly had some new elements and fun dlcs but i just loved the old 1404 its my favorite of the series i played 1701 1404 and 2205 the most out of them all but the all time winner atm is 1404 im hyped for anno 1800 i think it looks beautiful and im 100 gonna buy it yeah blessed are the cheesemakers i can hear your voice 2h without getin bored god do you know how much have i longed for anno 1404 remake not going to lie anno 2205 looks better then again its the first and only anno game i have played and i really enjoyed the style the water looks soooooo good i love the water in anno games im hyped will there be seasons winter fall ive always loved anno series each game looks adorable and makes me want to play but if only i could play it without falling asleep anno is the sleepiest game ive ever known for me at least idk if its the music or the gameplay itself or both this is the 1602 remake we have all been waiting for so waiting forward to it d still not better than 2070 this looks really good and right up my ally definitely getting it cant wait for a 1916 style i wonder how hard is it for them to make a curve road is there anyone here whos actually played the original greats of the series like 1602 ad and 1503 ad back before ubisoft bought the franchise and kind of corrupted and dumbed down the initial charm of the games honestly this looks almost exactly as anno 1404 infowould be possible to play anno 1800 even with a 4 years dated videocard obviously selecting low quality settings thanks my first ever video game was anno 1503 but i love anno 2070 lacked the soldiers i missed a lot but well i actually liked anno 2070 and 2205 2205 for going into the directions that are needed for the franchise in order for it to sustain itself and grow and for being effectively something to pass the time anno 2070 simply tried things that werent a thing beforehand and i started with the earlier isometric anno games for crying out loud hope they dont put stupid side missions and have to deal with npcs just want to build an army and conquer fan thats it the only real disappointment is i was hoping an anno 1800 if they were going to continue with trade routes being astracted like in anno 2205 then you could have offscreen train routes to cross the big deserts instead of oceans as you developed the western frontiers of the age then instead of the islands icecaps and space settting of 2205 youd have victorian seaside towns desert frontier towns and i dunno frozen mountain jungle of course this is all pointless if they went back to classic boats boats and more boats or i just predicted all the dlc for anno 1800 microtransaction rip anno 1800 i still have my anno 1404 game love that so much this looks great looks almost the same as 1404 anno 2070 was perfectly fine anno 2205 was a completely different game than every other game in the series so waiting for anno 1800 i must admit that i was a huge fan of anno 2070 and anno 2250 at the risk of sounding like an idiot etc but my question is this is a release date or general release date set the interface is really shit man i love anno but after two decades of them making this game i wouldve loved some more innovation still the same building grids no curved roads same style resource management maybe you dont fix what isnt broken but i feel there is plenty of room for changes withouth destroying what anno is all about havnt seen the full game yet but from this look it seems verry familiar thank for the review maam really looking forward to this anno 2070 is the best anno how can you say you didnt like the scifi when the whole game was perfect anno plus the soundtrack that 2205 or whatever did suck though too much changed can you make a army like in anno 1404 15 secs into the videoinstant buy take my money now this is an era that i want to play i loved the old games but how little they improve game to game just boggles my mind it looks almost exactly the same as 1404 im sick and tired of the grid based building 048 i think you were meant to say a bit too smothered by uplay the germans are lucky to have such a unique and amazing game developer very glad to hear this in english and im looking forward to playing it i hope wierdo like me who somehow see anno 2205 as the best anno game will enjoy this game d very interested in this greetings from brazil 018 ackchyually anno 1700 is no possible name for a game from the anno series because their digit sum must add up to 9 1602 1 6 0 2 9 1503 9 1701 9 1404 9 2070 9 2205 9 1800 9 super smartass mode off cool video 2070 was the best anno game 2250 wasnt a game at all i look forward to 1800 so bad it looks so promising bring back old anno gameplay pls honestly i liked anno 2070 the most the feature i want the most on anno is painting the ground for planning layouts it is really a chore to make complex layouts you have to count every square to see if everything fits so fucking great that they did not continue the disgusting teleportinggoods of the last anno game that just ruined the entire economy system nothing had to be connected everything magically teleported to the destination and no random maps sucked too thank god they went back to their roots done im buying this see devs that wasnt hard was it very simple dont remove huge parts of your game mechanics just iterate fans will be happy you will earn money win win can i kill the natives and acquire their resources i love that it looks so similar to dawn of discovery anno 2070 was the best anno 2205 went mainstream and dumbed down i love anno series 1404 and 2070 was really great while in 2070 the ai is kinda cheating but the ecobalance research the 2 faction system is great even 3 if you count the scientist faction saat and the arrc mod makes it even better im kinda sad with the series because a lot of people saying that anno 2k is garbage but 2070 is really great and still same with the traditional anno even i still played it today but i never personally played 2205 because its not my cup of tea im hoping that 1800 will be great but im sad that it back to only 1 faction unlike 2070 i feel insulted by valle comment saying there not enough englishspeaking fans for this awesome game that is dam lie i play with over 200 players who play this game here in the usa is it new dlc of anno 1404 come onguys u guys are better than this i hope that the ost will be as good as in the previous annos d not sure why i should buy a copy paste of every anno that came before is there a official release date loved 1404 looking good this and yes nothing beats the anno series and a good cup of tea my go to game series on my day off sadly it doesnt have a land compat system again kinda miss that good old canons from anno 1701 a shame they want to use denuvo drm welcome to the new anno exactly the same as the old anno i wanted to try anno but i wasnt gonna wait 46 hours kan i pley the damo i need the musics for anno 1800 isnt it about time they gave us curved roads i mean other city building games did it a decade or more ago ui is very dofferent then what i am used to anno 20701404 finally got sick of scifi shits after anno 1440 now we have 1800 d i like how you can now size the zone required for some of the resource buildings eg farms so you can fit them in more nicely and make them look more diverse but its kinda sad to see those 4 identical fisherman huts at the start of the video would be nice if you could at least modify the building different pier location or doorsmaterial on the outside or just have some completely different models i thought they were actually going to but i guess not judging from those fisherman huts still very excited for this game im sure im going to enjoy it let the layout perfecting process begin great video the interface seems a bit lifeless compared to 1404 there arent enough englishspeaking fans for this awesome game over here in germany anno is kind of big for a small game but outside of germany it needs more fans so thanks for making english content d anno 1404 is a great game however it has a major memory problem you can only play 2 to 4 hours before getting a memory warning and then it crashes on you visible tiles thats useful looks like a worthy succesor to 1404 i find the ui a bit underwhelming preferred the 1404 version on that very interested in seeing what this game will turn into the only thing i want from the anno series as a 1404venice player is better competitive multiplayer for more than 4 players and better combat does this have that or is it another reskin in my perspective the year of 1800 is not very interesting maybe they could do a medieval thing like in 8th to 12th century and use that island and ship thing to create viking raids or better they could use this to create a bc anno with the romans dunno but this 1800 thing seems very boring to me i hope they sell it well and i shall wait for the next one 2k annos are trash imo so im glad they kinda combined 1701 with 1404 also wouldve liked for a large map that is mediterranean kinda with islands far so you get the resources and to be played online how on earth buildings still not vary by design having 3 fishermans huts looking exactly the same is so stupid come on it 21st century i played a game sort of like this one i assume it is called banished i may give this one a shot thanks for the preview after great anno 1602 came bad 1404 and even vorst futuristic episodes this one looks like back to roots great 1700 cant be an anno total is not 9 2070 was a very good anno 2205 was an experiment from whom some gameplay aspects will be brought to anno 1800 this looks like such a copy of 1404 and a huge step back from the 2205 complexity actually loved that one fingers crossed that this is really far from finished and there will be a meaningful campaign as well the missios in the scifi installments were pretty cool and immersive i honestly didnt hate the sci fi setting anno 2205 was also amazing in its concept with the lunar colonization i think the biggest problem with that game was more its lack of replayability the removal of the randomization and shrouded maps and warfare which really were a big thing has anyone else noticed that the numbers of each anno game add to 9 i have never seen nor played any anno game is it like an advanced tropico game what is this diferent than the other ones i mean the other anno ones same thing play untill you get the map full of buildings and people then you can call the end of the game i loved anno 1404 played it for hundreds of hours but its been ten years and this really looks like a 1404 reskin still with the grid roads im afraid im gonna be disappointed what if jk rowling invest in a anno series 815 zanzibar oman ottomans do you know what culture she represents up the alliance of workers and peasants big question are maps randomly generated like in old anno games or are they all premade again they want the p very nice to see some gameplay its looks a lot like the anno we know i cant wait to play this btw is there any battle system applied i know anno isnt all about battling other island npcs but it was a nice feature which i hope has more depth to it in this game thank you very much for the coverage i just found the video now i am happy the video is so detailed and the game is designed in the classic anno historical style thank you the future is dwarf fortress with a decent graphics this shit is old 1404 still worls perfectly would highly recomend anno 1404its expansion venice that added some sweet sweet yees we are friends now leets play the spy game but not from steam from gog instead good old games leeting you have an actuall complete install file without drm bs would love to watch the unedited wodor catch it live of a few of the yogs playing a game over a few firday evnings can just imagen lewis vs duncan vs hannahlewis declaring he out compete them allhannah giving him the finger and boosting a war fleet and coatal deffenses walls gates etc to raid his shiping with impunityand duncan turning his two ilands into fortresessand sneaking some ships loaded with undercover agents onto the shores of the others to try and ruin ther cities in plauge or steel cash with belly dancers xd above all though the last two gamesleets say the simplification words dumbed down sometimes is an apt one wich is a shame considering how much more deepth you co my favourite annos are in order 1404 1602 2070 1503 1701 2205 i am not actually sure if 1602 or 2070 is my number two 1602 was one of my favourite childhood games but 2070 is basicly a better optimized version of 1404 i never got warm with the art style of 1701 and while i think 2205 was a great game on its own i wouldnt actually categorize it as an anno because to many factors that identify the series in its core are gone as far as i see anno 1800 combines the best sites of all annos it gives me hard 1404 vibes has the multi session of 2205 but with normaly generated maps multiple playable cultures like in 20701404 graphics of 2205 and so much more the game really has the potential to become the best anno so far this looks like 1404 but somehow feels like 1602 im moderately hyped love the whole thing but the ui they have to change it and make it look more artistic like anno 1440 its nice to see anno returning to its roots 1602 was my first pc game at all and i have played all of them except the last one i have high hopes for this one and really looking forward to playing it ive been playing 1404 a lot recently this looks good anno is definitely one of my favourite series played 1503 1404 1701 and 2070 if anyone is having a hard time finding anno 1404 on steam in some countries i dont know if its just mine or not it is called dawn of discovery finally a recent video on anno 1800 thats in english hopefully this more optimized for the cpu also still no curved or diagonal roads the first anno i ever played was anno 1701 still got it on disc somewhere and i loved it and ive pretty much played every anno since ill be sure to pick this up looks great shiiiiit i used to play 1503 so much with my brother cant wait for this it looks like a mix between anno 2205 and 2070 with the best bits of both games the ui looks more 2205 though hopefully the game is as complex as anno 2070 or 1404 though thats what really killed 2205 for me hope youre having a great time d the first time i played anno was on the ds years ago it was fun but had it falts 027 can confirm anno 1404 does work on at least my modernday system 044 same though given i only played anno 1404 which i found out via the lewis flax playthrough way back when i probably dont count 208 wait population is actually required to run industries now when did that get introduced 230 do the houses not autoupgrade between low and high 522 rivers bridges were in 1404 they get removed inbetween and are river sites still needed for specific industries 738 harambe lives 1100 it is indeed on uplay would love to see more tbh anno 1404 gold edition is also available in gogcom are you a manly woman or a feminine man have to say that out of all the annos my favorite one and the one that got me into the series in the first place has to be anno 2070 oh my god anno 1404 was sooooooo great love it cant wait for this how did i forget about this this looks so good omg merchants are op in this game like in medieval 2 tw simply op ikr d ah poor views because you should have zoomed in and showed the games potential instead you stayed in the same view and rushed it still watched a tad tho clicked on for lulz saw his lost look slight skepticism kicked in checked the channels gaming history was good watched for 2 minutes to see how he chooses game difficulty was concerned he was gonna go easy since braindead chat told him so he chose advanced but not impossible perfect 5 minutes in im making myself popcorn putting on headphones turning off the lights full screen mode thanks for the fun man you got me hooked really enjoyed watching you so basically tropico start an anno 1800 full access play through 729 likes this game blew up hope u recorded even though u didnt stream legend youre the best man what a time waste appears you played it for 8 hours straight i like it i also consider this normal behavior im a simple man i see legend trying to escape his fate as an eternal total war player i boycott the video jk thats a great game why the heck people disliked wtf hey legend id appreciate if you could try the medieval ii third age mod total war as gondor thanks i fucking loved that venezuela reference xd im from there looks like a cool game not quite as awesome tho for me as either paradox or total war sandbox games but something i could see myself playing for a good few months before burnout and thats ok hey legend this is kind of off topic but i was wondering if you would do a prophet and the warlock campaign for warhammer 2 the new lizard men faction play kind of like the dark elves which i thought you enjoyed this game seems really cool but i dont want to support it because ubisoft pulled it off of steam and put it on the epic game store instead these recordings of livestreams always start like 4 hours in for about a day or two best to wait for a while damn trying to watch this before its been fully uploaded 052 anno 1701 background music the game needs more monuments to diversify sections of islands or islands inbetween more special structures etc i mean who doesnt want to build a military section or a small fort etc i really love the anno series id love to see a mars edition as well game looks awesome its a damn shame its not on steam and ill never play it even this video itself lags when i run it on 1080 can i run this game i got goosebumps when i saw that nighttime city sorry50 euros for this game is s jokr i bet somewhere there down in the city is some assasin jumping from roof to roof i have the season pass and i do like the game however a great deal of the add ons should have been free with the base game day night cycle everythingelse looks cool i hope they work to simplify the trading system i feel a lot of the legend of korra vibes coming from this its not showing up in games free games category whats up can i play on ps4 this game is goooood if you like civ try this game also winter dlc is basically frost punk which is an amazing base building game play that first im so addicted to this game i had never heard of this game but that soundtrack tho you just got some money from my ubi so what ever happened to skull and bones not first thanks for watching the anno 1800 campaign series would you like to see this campaign continue for us rebuilding bright sands and upgrading to engineers if so get this video up to 2000 likes so i know you like it enough to do more otherwise we can focus more on the raptoria series your vote counts so like now 3 i just wish they put in infantry even just some simple musket troops wouldve been insanely cool raptor sounds like cgp greyif you disagree thats fine they at least have a similar speech rhythm you shouldnt lure them in and run away while they bombard your ships you gotta commit this game looks pretty well done graphics are good music seems good however there are no land units only boats im only seeing city building and naval battles im not sure if i wan to get this one i will watch more thanks for your video when you suddendly finish the game and you feel happy and sad and empty at the same time you feel your chest is so tight and then you start crying coward and stupid dude i never figured out how to expedite your citizens i always end up taking one or two hours to get to artisan from worker and thats if i focus only on one island always makes it hard to win the race to the new world but nothing better on multiplayer than being the first to get there and claiming the most resource rich island as your hub toths they always laugh at funerals looks good makes me wanna buy anno im afraid i dont know how to play this types of games wow the enemies are so easier does anno only have naval battles lol that loot was very important boaty mc boat anno 1404 still better wont even touch this one ubisoft commercial fail these games look good but are they actually worth the money not have steam this game massive invashion coming worring about the lack of hops dude now is not the time to fix the economy or do anything like that cause now we got war george w bush fits like a glove lol that lag when panning is nauseating one day this game will be on steam and i will buy it the music is awesome in this game d why isnt this showing up on steam having played all of the anno games over the years i must say this game is absolutely the cream of the crop you only had 100k by then i was already in the millions in my bank xd i was producing a big ol navy i got that item character that made my fleet cost 50 upkeep which boost my economy very high im seeing two episode eights on the same day any answers everyone you saved the world raptor gimme my loot this game has some sweet music sounds like star wars music then daenerys comes with drogon and voila dracerys this battle was over so fast if you just inched your fleet within range and spammed torpedoes name your flagship ezherzog ferdinand max former flagship of the royal austrian navy dumb ai with no tactics ship names spite wrath malice enmity rancor and viscious well successful streamers is either funny or very good i dont know how to classify this one tbh no scenarios no elector diplomat master builder general imperator just a shitty 4 episode campaign everthing changed when the fire nation attacked is there no auto trade the music though you should name one of your ships the sea crown or the ocean pearl what the game name please the music reminded me at some parts of the moment in bioshock when they introduce you to a new ability could you take the cotton seed fertility back to the old world great job learned a lot from you 1651 you can legit see both fleets at the same time in the same screen and this genius decide its a good time to pan the camera over to somewhere else and not pay attention to the enemy fleet for any sign of preemptive movement to attack i mean seriously do you even tactical game the following oh gods and panicking as the obviously aggroed enemy fleet comes barreling into his noteveninaformation fleet actually hurts to even watch its only because he had overwhelming superior firepower and ship numbers that it did not turn out into a total fiasco i dont get any sound when the avatars speak in the pc game i hate you ubisoft now that i find out your trying to change history like many other game companies revising history with your games name your ships after subscribers british fleet vs spanish fleet also hit that like button this game dont have army unit i love watching his videos its like i am watching a strategy movie its amazing i got to this part and im seriously wondering are they going to leave it just as that i mean anne she mentions that for some reason she recognizes the grandmaster of the enemy also should continue this campaign there is still alot of things you can do so how the hell do ships burn down a whole city when there is no land combat this game has some major issues especially in later game i dont think the production development was very well thought out with this title it is sad to see that there is only this mission in the game 1404 had a huge amount of scenarios looks like the devs wanted a very basic game but paid dlc ofc i always found it weird and a waste of time to watch someone play video games turns out i was wrong i spent hours watching this series and waiting for you to upload a new video thanks for this series the voluptuous read description and liked loving the anno 1800 series really enjoy watching both the campaign and sandbox videos im enjoying both the sandbox and the campaign series please keep them both going if not both then upgrade the one you keep going to 15 or 2 hours per episode thanks for the great work im enjoying both the sandbox and the campaign series please keep them both going if not both then upgrade the one you keep going to 15 or 2 hours per episode thanks for the great work pls continue this campaign raptor and rebuild that city d you should line your ships better instead of having them in a clump spread them out and decrease the dmg taken you do more dmg bcz all your ships can fire main broad side ship name hellboy name your toughest warships sylvana sylvius and urbanus anno is a beautiful and fun game but in regards of naval battles nothing has changed it is still horrible why it cant be like napoleon total war rebuild cos 99 of viewers dont show their love i also finished the campaign got the 500 engineers on bright sands build the oil wells and trains however i have no way to transport it without a tanker ship i cant seem to build it in both worlds any ideas make hms boaty mcboatface the flagship age of mythology flashbacks gold old times id love to see you rebuild bright sands and see you going engineer and research and conquer everything also everyone read description edit i always laugh at funerals wut that cracked me up thanks for making my day d hey raptor just a quick one did you know all materials have a base value as such even if the npcs such as the prison guy isnt specifically requesting anything you can still just sell to him glass panes are a really good money maker 1020000 a pop with just a skooners load damn i wish i could play this game i only bought it a week ago and im still waiting for ubisoft to figure there shit out and figure out why it wont let me download it now that was simple names for ships uss arizona the uss utah musashi bismarck grafzeppeln the tirpitz and dont forgett yamato raptor i destroyed that whole fleet with one gunboat no jokes i really enjoy this series i hope you continue it id love to see you rebuild bright sands im sorry but no steam no game the enemy is about to attack but you dont build more big guns around your harbor really i have to try anno 1404 but i believe they did not had womens voice on ships back then well that was abrupt nice video raptor i do hope to see you do a tropico campaign again someday maybe actually fight pinto or a solo campaign i love whatever you do i will support i have 280 m coin in sandbox you should definitely continue this campaign after all there is still a lot of work to be done and the island of bright sands needs the touch of a raptor to bring it even greater glory than it ever had before ps read the description yall well done raptor and thanx for this i really enjoyed this and hopes that you will continue this serie yamato the most powerful battle ship in naval history shipname hms avalon my bday today and youtube wont download this mans video fuck u yt im patiently waiting for the sandbox episode its not a bug they didnt attack youre supposed to attack them enjoyed the episode by the way 3 just go at them champion you are the best man rrs unsinkable rrs stands for republic of raptoria ship wow i almost see the british navy raptor do you record your video in advance or after each episode just curious cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war my residents are mad at me scott play more anno i just finished the campaign in 1 sitting wtf why is it so short scott try using the fast forward button sometimes in top right corner i hope you continue with this game i really like it more pls so enjoying this game what about doing some days gone videos and rage 2 videos would love to see more of this as a series anger when you pay your uncle you shall defy him and make sure you have roads connected around the warehouse some building need roads on a particular side keep this coming thank you please keep this game going would love go see more to help make my decision to buy i love the anno series i would have never imagined that you would even consider playing it it is really time consuming though anyways awesome vid this game looks so fun have you ever thought about playing dynasty warriors 8 empires bro the game is fun but it hurts seeing how you play it but thats just me if only the anno series was on playstation or xbox or switch i do like playing these type of sim games whether it is city building or being a rail tycoon who in here tryna start a riot a game riot that is definitely play more bro can u play world war z i really want to see you play the game this is a good game love the channel when are you doing a giveaway again gameriot ad is actually the short form of anno domini which is the part of a latin phrase which literally means in the year of our lord jesus christ who else wants a game which combines strategy with shooter for example exploring the world like in skyrim and building your own village like in this game anno edit i just found a game called life is feudal where you can switch to a character and play for him but its shooter mechanics are not good enough those facial animations look a bit weird especially the sister its like muppets with the mouth just opening and closing without forming words definitely play more yippee something to watchdo ty scott please make a series of the new walking dead game its awesome and im sure you will enjoy it should have called your self cole what in the world is this game about ps i have not watched the video cant say ive ever heard of anno lol but heres a new series to look forward to have a good easter

and extremely detailed review i needed this i dont play any games that are on epic store until they are released on other stores would love to get it but doubt my hp laptop could run it properly tnx gunna buy it now thanks to you my favorite anno is 2070 2205 was a disgrace to the series i want to play 1800 as soon as it returns to steam i loved this game i had the priviledge of playing this for few days in trial period the lip sync is perfect for the language it was meant for is bad hanover a pun i cant help how unnatural roads are in this game otherwise its a great game used to love these games rember the patrician too bad i dont have the time to play them anymore i always wonder how it sounds when you laugh really hard love your videos and i fancy them to learn new stuff because they are interesting and to fall asleep because they are so calming been there since a few months keep it going thank you great review just a empty eyecandy shell in 2019 still can not make curves only straight lines and 90 angles roads this game gets boring after three hours and with the aggravation of never having mods looks like a decent game but uplay and denuvo make it no for me word filters are dumb imagine if the word race was censored on a racing game goes back to what the original anno games were like and i thought i wouldnt buy this mainly due to the era but i was wrong i actually love the game and the era it is set in is actually great still want another game set in the 1400s though when i saw the title i was expecting to hear something about some of the poor design choices made for this title in the franchise i didnt hear anything about restrictions though heres a couple of examples of restrictions that has never been in an anno before building efficiently is punished one of the core concepts of building in the franchise has always been about making the most of the limited land you have to build on in all previous anno titles you were never punished for putting your factories next to each other to maximize the efficiency of them getting and delivering materials in 1800 this exponentially increases their hazard chances four schnapps factories built next to each other will always have a chance of exploding and do frequently regardless of how many fire stations you have directly next to them the only counter to this is the trade union and winning the lottery on the item that entirely negates explosion chance which i assume exists but ha i dont like that it costs influence when i build ships i have huge islands and i need a big fleet but this is nearly impossible to do i agree for the most part but some of the points mentioned fe the church being only availablr after youve reached workes are due to balancing just play the game in german if u want the right lip sync i could live in this game never leaving the house influence is needed for ships so u wont have 200 of the best ships etc its been 12hrs straight its better than anno 1404 isnt it sounds like youre reading from a press release script towards the church should be available earlier yeah i guess but thats always how anno has worked not that you get the church late but that you need to setup a settlement knowing that later there will be a building you need to find a place in the middle of an already existing sector to that end i use the new blueprint placement and plan out my settlements with empty area in the middle for schools theaters churches etc i like the combat system and some improvements but overall i like the settings of 2205 more the cross map management moon etc just miss the underwater from 2070 a great video but please learn the right pronunciation of schnaps naps and yes its writed on purpose in this waythanks cant help watching this and going that house placement is not optimal whats the market doing there arrrggghhh xxd this game is great but has some potential game breaking flaws for example my capital of montepelican has only engineers and 10000 investors but the newspaper guy keeps complaining about a lack of town centres and pubs while engineers and investors dont need those types of facilitys so the media is writing about people not having access to to facilitys that exactly not even ask for no untill its no longer an exclusive 1602 was my first game i played on my own pc in 1998 and i love the franchise after the terrible 2070 and 2205 games 1800 is a great game again i love how complex it gets in the lategame i got the game for 22 so im very happy with it i sometimes gain morale on the expeditions once i still had 100 after 3 events its basically factorio with houses and citizenry to satisfy the production chains arent as involved but they still require you jumping several hoops to get some stuff done when rich peeps want their stuff from the new world and a 2 way trip takes over 10 minutes real time anno 1800 is ok but it doesnt do anything new it also is easy to beat by spamming ships and just wiping your enemies coastal cities and spamming buildings that make you money it also isnt the best econosimcity sim right now its a true anno game but compared to other econosimcity builders like rise of industry its pretty simplistic if youre a fan of the anno series i say go for it otherwise if youre hardcore into econosimscity builders get something else there are a lot more out there now and a lot better ones than there used to be i feel as though you need to relax more when reading your scripts the worst restriction is the epic store at least there is the ubisoft store epic does not get a single cent from me thanks for the vid you are wrong about expeditions tho i increased crews morale lots of the times even from 50s to 100 in few choices it depends on how much you were prepared for the expedition starting with higher chance might give higher success chance on choices part and morale increase chance i guess supreme commander forged alliance looks like this and is from 2007 oh god that building layout is pure torture i just spent an hour watching videos of this game and was about to buy it epic games store exclusive aaaaand never mind i tried to name my ship pufferfish and it told me that it was inappropriate language apparently it doesnt like the word puff annocant remember wich one is definetly one of the games that got me into this genre of gamesbut i will not support a worthless developer on top of them using denuvorather throw my money at random games on gog 2400 games are made for macrotransactions master race now censor the truth 1530 thats how ubisoft does it in the real world too scam business on global scale yeah screw ubisoft not only the drms restrictions epic games store exclusivity but censoring words that are not offensive what the actual fuck thank god i boycotted this asinine game company long ago the character 3d models are very good like really good 538 why is half the screen always out of view would be helpful to actually see the worker shortage in numbers while youre talking about it please make merch that says more on that later would legit buy i love the game seriously but it crashes so often for me its crazy the crashes are my reminder to stop playing for a bit i am not really affected by the lip syncing the game is awesome and i recommend it to all diseases make sense on higher dense population becase farmers live and shit on freelandnon populated while in mediaval cities like london people used to shit and piss on the streets where the diseases come from im fed up with reviewers talking about lip sync the game design is made so the characters are not lip syncd its been like that since the first anno it is designed that way in no way that is bad or unnatural makes full sense also there is full audio translation for 6 or 8 other languages all using the same lip sync what other game does anything remotely none i watched this the other day but had to come back to comment on how great it was great video as always overlord the developer is german they likely based the lipsync on german speakers adding english sounds later influrnce for building ships should be removed great review mate what would anno be like in the year 40k if you were a highlord of the imperium are you going to get a new mic so this is cities skylines but not focusing on traffic its appropriate that this game has piracy in it because thats the only way its going to be played for many 20 to 40 fps on a 1080ti is not an acceptable performance for a topdown city builder like anno 1800 great video though the previous anno 2205 also had a reminder to take a break i saw it at every 2 hours passable 40fps on 1080ti lul na performance is still dogshit typical developers of a quite good game being fucked by the publisher i do not like the style of review and therefor would like to make some suggestions when comparing how you explained the evolution of the city and the soundtracks i like the part about the soundtrack much more you say what you like about it and give an example but when you explain the citybuilding it become more talking about the mechanics and not how it feels i think it would be enough to say that there are different production chains the further the city grows the more complex it becomes detailed information about what sort of need it is or how the need really work is not really interesting for a review also consider seperating the video into different chapters with timestamp in chapter focus on one topic and at the end of the chapter there is a short screen summarizing the pros and cons also i am surprised about your thoughts on performance many people complain about performance problems and it seem to cause crashes when you get to the 4th and 5th population level and performance has improved significantly 2040fps 1080ti that is not acceptable for a toptown city builder even on highvery high and at 1440p 630 global business warfare where more people die than in an actual military warfare it just takes more time for people to realize they are actually at war 515 garbage sync game with this should be free game made as a hobby not fucking aaa game 015 no game is made by ubisoft it has denuvo it has garbage optimization 23 cpu idling pro tip if you want kind of locked 60fps just turn down lightning effects to minimum rest can stay at hight or ultra feedback crowds on medium i got more or less 60 fps on gtx 1060 with city of 15k i really want this game seen people like rtgame play this genre so fun to watch should play anno 1800 is rts close video your voice is so clear and refreshing to hear i played one of the anno games all they amount to in the end is tedious micro management of trade routes it get boring and fast hate to say it but it also hurts to hear overlord gaming claim that everyone should try a ubisoft game im sorry but if you arent boycotting ubisoft games youre doing it wrong loved your series on denuvo and talking about that really suited your dryish delivery and nononsense tone but probably less suited to reviews in my head u are known as the denuvo guy p the point of anno is having more and more stuff to unlock the more you advance doesnt matter if its historically acurate or not its better gameplay that way if too much stuff is unlocked churches hospitals at the start of the game new player will be overwhelmed besides anno was never a game that tried to be historically acurate anyway there is no mention of any nations or important persons no mention of specific history events anno puts gameplay above historical accuracy they intentionally romanticize history in their games so i think its weird to criticize the game for that cant wait till its cracked so we can play without denuvo d why crew loses morale after both won or lost expedition events isnt well explained its basically the morale that is lost over the journey outside of this event that requires your attention however this event has its own morale loss on certain failure paths but also morale gain in a lot of sucessful event paths particularly noticible in hightier expeditions 3 stars the constant morale loss prevents an expedition to have no apparent stakes to it as you can see the morale draining constantly yourself furthermore events arent simply lost or won theres more detailed rewards and losses to it but in general as long as you win certain amount of events the morale bar wont reach 0 by the end of the mission whilst losing one too often can force you to bring your expedition back or if particularly reckless even lose your ship and its crew due to the mistakes you made it sounds like colonization meets sim city your narrator voice is mesmerising oof you should do some trailer parody this is the best channel when it comes to gaming such a great channel thanks for the entertainment its strange that ur sponsored by this game and no one wants to support it at all because epic shit store killed our enthusiasm i am legitimately surprised you havent whined about epic being bad for whatever reason i heard that shit gets clicks so its like tropico 6 but racetarded i rly love this channel oof looks like they kept the lip syncing of the german version which is a bit better but still insanely horrible malthouse guy looks like charlie great video the ships costing influence thing is for balance so you cant mass produce ships right away looks great this was the first anno game that i didnt buy yes since 1602 im old however as i dont preorder and im not using egs because of their exclusivity nonsense and uplay as i dont want my games all over the place i would buy it if it was on gog or steam until then its a pass thanks anno makes me appreciate the complexity of economics anno is one of the only city games where you place down everything manually and boy do things get complicated fast if i buy this through uplay does it track gameplay hours through the client dude i learned from your channel how bad ubisoft for the pc gaming industry is and now youre telling me that i should play their newest pc game im confused never tried an anno game and since civ isnt so great after 5 this is the perfect time to dive in right i have burned many many hours on 1404 2070 2205 and i hope to burn many more on 1800 when it isnt sixty fucking bucks jesus they loose morale because they are 6 months or more thousands of kilometers away from home while eating shitty food and danger at every meter on the way they want home i remember playing games like caesar 3 good times sadly not on steam anymore i dont preorder never have thats why i dont buy it when it was still offered on steam well their lost i guess not getting my money for it vmprotect denuvo yeah no thanks looks up the game and sees its published by ubiand therefore has uplay drm and sees that it has denuvo and is an egs exclusive harddddddddddddddd pass i would play it if it didnt require uplay and if i could trust the developers to make something that works as far as i am aware they never got around to fixing the bugs in 1404 wtf is up with that gpu power are you on vega these guys pulled the game off steam as well pity i was looking forward to trying out this game me nice game might want to try it outheard it has denuvo exclusive to egson second thought screw ubi i am taking my money elsewhere is there an older anno game worth playing to see if i like the genre i have limited money and while i have anno 2070 it just refuses to run server issues or some shit idk i have bought on u play plus used 100 upoints for 20 discount f epic btw try this in game ctrl shift r thank me later amazing review i have been waiting for the game more than 1 year its just perfect why does the mic quality change every video i am happy that anno finally gets the worldwide attention it deserves the lack of free form and diagonal roads bothers me but as someone who has never played an anno game im quite intrigued dude my brother has been watching this game and telling me its gonna be good we differ slightly in game tastes so i was a little doubtful but you swayed any of that so you still cannot build diagonal or even free form road why ubisoft the visuals sometimes remind me of ac black flag great review thanks thanks for this og im actually going to buy this game because of your review hey og grats on 50k subs it makes sense that propaganda is need to incite the citizenry into war many nations have done this for years well ill fricking play it if overload gmaing says so dont bother purchasing the game they screwed over steam and their customers with their anticonsumer practices find a way to pirate the game instead third curious to know what your keybinds are like have you changed them up at all that was an entertaining stream i love how your shits burning down faster than you can speedbuild maybe try cursing less lol wish this was in 1080p good to watch just hurts the eyes after awhile why u spreading your wood production out so mutch u can have them on 75 without loosing on production time no need to go for 100 on many of the overlapping buildings how do you know how many farmers each building supports like you said 300 cloth for 1 do you use a shortcut to build farmfields im looking for that shortcut that would save me so much time sch read it as one letter not snaps 11118 the real pirate spirit is there a hotkey to build the farm tiles eg the potato fields for potato farm just dont give this guy amphetamines otherwise you cant watch the video at 025x speed hey bud if you have made a fast build with descriptive commentary and layout explanation and reasoning would you be kind to link it i love rts and city planning games and would love to see a video i do plan on buying this game this is not the highest difficulty if you play on large islands the challenge is to play it on small islands where space is key the optimisation is nice but not doable on expert level eh this isnt really optimizing more like supersizing if youre rushing for artisans you shouldnt build like this there has to be an asian doing things better then us right why do you fucking shout allt the time is there a list for how many people certain resource buildings support like how many people that 1 pig farm provides for what a douche watch ur potty mouth new here love the content i play a zerg style in pvp atm its not super fun because people quit after you start the rush and there is no real reward for winning its more fun to rush things like monuments if you want to play against a zerg style opponent dm me im down please go 1080p or higher really enjoyed the vid but literally have sore eyes finally someone that knows what the fuck hes doing too many personality hack youtubers doing shitty gameplay of this game that frigate micro thou so 2x6 is actually the better option for the village structure than 2x3 so freaking fast so cool nice video how do you know how many production buildings you need per how many citizens time to rush the sausage azn from the theyre billions is that you changed your channel name i dont know if it was a different patch but i think the numbers are off i found a steam guide listing quantities that seem to be right seems like most values are doubled from what you had fish does 800 schnapps does 600 etc you could do with a good headphonemice for audio other than that super awesome wow starting with 11 woodand i thought i was being overkill with 4 o finally some advanced gameplay cant wait for the future episodes please dont give up on this series hey deadly optics found you playing they are billions loved it looking forward to you playing more city building games do you think some day you would do a tutorial play through of anno 1800 wow you got a lot better fast going full throttle love it a joy to watch instead of all the other lets play where guys are second guessing every move and still suck welcome back i slow rolled it to this point so i had about 2 million in the bank i did find that i was able to put a lot of stuff on the bright sands docks to buy and it kept it pretty well supplied in the early stages seemed like i was importing a lot of schnapps clothes and sausage especially at this point im on 16m and 23k need advice xd do your ships automatically use the special weapons they are carrying bc it doesnt look they they are being used i saw easter eggs come up 3 or 4x yet it doesnt say what it was for its just for random zooming into 1st person the more and more i play and see this game the worse its becoming im already getting bored of its repetitive gameplay so i watch more than i play the mathematical analytics that this game basically runs off seems bugged as shit why does your income jump from 200k to 300k 3630 for no reason other than a simple pan around your town it makes no sense whatsoever 1351 husk is the word you paused for was the secret boringsome tunnels call a ship sweets seawater and whenever you start planting sugar cane have it trade the item between islands i love the easter eggs the secret when u first person at a limestone factory you probably should start jotting down where you left off to help you swiftly get back into the grove where you left off just an suggestion build defences at bright sands keep the good work up man you are amazing you so help me get a great start in the game and its so great to see you work through things which are giving me a headache thanks yeah i will set up trade route on next episode said raptor on every episodes enjoying this series keep up the good work mr raptor 1034 the wind blowing from north sail ships are not good for going against the wind on mini map and also if bring your camera up close to the selected ships you will see the wind direction in see battle please escape from from your foes in the same direction with the wind flow its pretty cool if you make trade routes you win the game found 300k did you see where secrets secrets we need a ship called bismarck pride of a nation a beast made of steel my maintenance cost is around 21k im good with cash as of now with 12 million i would like suggestions to reduce the costs please keep the content coming its nice to watch you play when im not playing myself glad to see youre moving forward with this play through because i find it a lot more engaging than the pure sandbox one i guess im just more invested in these cities since there was a real sense of meaningful progression to them if you go to 5353 it says on the top left eastereggfound something ive wondered about can you make a trade route between new and old world pro tip to see the ratios of the buildings such as grain farm flour mill and bakery the small menu that pops up it will say 1 minute for grain farm 2 minutes for flour mill and 1 minute for bakery so farm and bakery is 11 but mills are 21 yaay more its great to see how you manage to make the game look both fun and interesting hey raptor there is a secret easter egg at the limestone quarry if you go int first person in it you will receive 300000 cash it happened to another youtuber keralis the secret youre gonna livestream naked electricity u need to have the nautilus spelling your flagship needs to be clever girl httpsyoutubeto5wryddei0 electricityy got bored of revising popped onto youtube going to watch a bit of this and the crack on excellent one name of your ship spirit breaker or night stalker my time revolves around your anno series dude connect all your roads at brightsands it will help alot first game save failed anyone else got problem than me if you like krumpak i bet you also like krumbhaar different kinds of crumbs but similar feel i think i really wish robin named her phill my krumpak why does the chinese princess have a finnish city name d kalap means fish head in finnish such a wholesome stream love these types of games with robin wait its called schnapps thats what we say here in germany but with only one p pretty sure subtitles on youtube were designed for robin he seems to be the only person whos subtitles are actually correct keeping that articulation game high p i usually dont use subtitles but i was munching some crisps anno means year in italian how about titanic as a synonym for huge lol artsy fartsy put to death in the city i think you have bitten off more then you can chew how many different games are you playing at the same time youre getting confused and it just makes you look like a bad gamer you need trade routes ps i know im behind im watching from the start while im off work stone roads give jou more reach for publik buildings and also mor produktion speed for the econemy buildings transport speed to warehouses thats gross colossal hulking and titanic are some pretty epic ones raptor hey iv been watching most of your anno videos and love the way your camera and mouse movements are did you change your anno default control settings if so can you tell us thanks keep up the good work dude your passion and interest in the game is really paying off hope the burnout dont exhaust you anytime soon and when it does just know that its okay to move on its gross until the raptorian navy gets on the scene and helps them hi this video is not in the playlist for some reason i accidentally saved an empty sandbox game over my campaign no notification they had the same name so im watching your videos to pep me up to start again both your anno series are very entertaining to watch so i was wandering around one of my ports in first person mode ctrlshiftr and noticed the time on the clock tower actually changes and is synced to my pc time the attention to detail has just hit unprecedented levels i think you placed a firestation near your big factory district between 2 rail ways if possible can you find a small island to make zoo and museum it looks like not wanting to make your own shipping routes is creating more things for you to remember and to forget seriously set up the trade routes so you can spend more time building and less time trying to get resources to the right place its very inefficient synonym for big colossal lol those mortars sitting idle in your harbor could help destroy an enemy harbor in about two volleys bruh kermit thee frog here yeah rohit bhargava is actually the founder of the non obvious company the great western is a real ship however it is technically classified as a steam ship it did have sails but they were used as auxiliary propulsion the ship build was also credited to william paterson for anyone whod like to know 102 you need more bricks just go and watch russell westbrook play raptor first question where is episode 11 and second question why dont you take out beryl to help out the princess since you like her and then let the princess have some more of the islands i believe you can increase the service range of building by upgrading paths to paved roads how do you pan around the map so fast do you have a maxed out gaming pc or are there keyboard shortcuts raptor why dont you see if you can buy potato seeds fertility for bright sands next re name your main city raptoria i miss raptoria the back bone of the raptor alliance long live raptoria werent you going to build a commuter port never mind you already built it how did i miss that raptor i am extremely disappointed you did not make building the world fair fairly easy a joke shouldnt this be ep 11 where is the ep11 could you do a fun little challenge colonize a large island with no industryfarms and get it all the way to investors capital with just importing everything i think it would be kinda fun to watch browhere is episode 11 they should of made two or more new worlds ascessably with 5 or more various of new world types um where is episode 11 nice design good gameplay and interresting commentary deff liked the video how long does interest in new releases last usually and is there a difference in or shift from larger more established channels such as ones with millions of followers and the smaller channel community all hail the glorious raptoria loving it from a non game player just love watching how your narrative and play a1 always watching from australia another one woooooooo first like comment and view what if you sort by what cargo the ship was carrying i just love that you casualy dismiss the workers riot lol i am so confused about this where did that destroyed island come from and how did episode 13 end in negative income and episode 14 started positive income lol love the videos im watching both series as well keep up the great anno content im watching both series what key stroke is used to get the closeup first person camera thanks hey raptor how do you zoom in all the way to street eye level oo technically the bank does give money it improves the income of every engineerinvestor household the same is true for all met needs btw meeting the needs increases the taxes they pay you need separate islands for separate types of people youre trying to make everything work for everyone on each island spread it out and it will better everyone is watching both series at least they better be p man you build police station too far away from the riots yes i watch both series lol every episode before ep 13 you always say well get a warship this time and so on except this time we finally did it raptor read comments just import all the cheap goods like fish and flour etc excellent series you are responsible for my purchase of this game it is my first anno game in almost 20 years and my first game purchase in quite a while it is quite addictive one question how do you toggle postcard view thank you in advance totally forgot about the engineers buildings you moved ditchwater should be brightwater the resourses and infrastructure to survive only thing of society is when it grow larger nature loses its grand feel to the bussel of society ive watched every anno 1800 from prereleases to both games will it be released on steam 5999 is kinda steep for me right now i am watching both lol on your last vid in the series you should just walk through the entire city in the ground view getting investors also means you can build the monitor steam warship im watching both series to learn more about the battleships good job stabilizing your economy by taking over their islands i love how this series is 10k in income and the other is 10k oil tanker namescyclone and cyclops investors give influence by the way you have archibald right nearby he sells steel bricks and planks it really helps sometimes and if you run out of gold eli has gold ore cant wait to see how youll rebuild your both cities when youve unlocked everything you should build a new island from scratch i think you should set up the train railroads on the island youre rebuilding setting it up allows you to have electricity all over without it looking unorganized more anno ive been watching both series and i am loving watching keep up the good work buy coal and iron from prison shit im watching both serieskeep them pumping out love the content im waiting on that raptoria episode time to build the world expo fair much more to do and rebuild im watching bit series its just hard because both series were named the same thing nice more anno raptor please please build guns at your harbours you dont wanna loose more islands especially in the new world there your fleet are week i love annoy but honestly this sandbox is pretty much useless now that the story is done personally i only watch the raptorian serie i think reallly should reorganize stuff i wonder if all the destroyed buildings in bright sand are causing people to get sick more often hii me is 9 yrs old waifu chan what is sandbox love this series love ur videos i try to like and comment as much as i can there are still many videos i still need to watch of yours love your games and tactics and organizing things in this game and men of war by the time i was at the start of your video i had almost 100000 maybe i need to stream lol is it just me or does this guy sound just like airforceproud95 brick roads accelerate movement very important for faster cargo movement in the city and aim all fire on one ship the smallest and most damaged first the ships look great and move pretty well except for when combat starts then they just stand still and exchange fire that goes against a basic tactic of naval combat they need to keep the ships maneuvering in fact they should allow the player to assign different combat tactics to focus on outmaneuvering position firing coordinated fleet maneuvers in some regard otherwise the combat gets stale very quick and just becomes a number and size game would be great if ship captains gained experience and increased in such skills so small ship captains that are skilled have a chance versus the larger ships weird the town looks so different in this video with no explanation that you had completely remade it though everyone can play the game how they like i think resource balancing is one of the key problems you are supposed to handle so just eyeballing the number of production buildings is not the most efficient way to develop a city only one problem with you raptor you exagerate your navy too many frigattes man their costing you money try to make some gunboats less expensive less materials to make them their fast agile and in numbers can do good damage of course youll need the big ships but try not to put yourself too much in the red also you can create patrol paterns for military vessels so you can make your trade routes more secure for your schooners love your videos keep em comming ill keep watching them ship names cutter cut less dreadnought victory dragon you should have accepted the princesss alliance at the star of the video she was gonna give you 15000 can u sell soap to the prison does it actually explain anywhere that you need 20 steel beams to colonize a new island because i had to look it up stone roads extend the distance that buildings radiate their effect markets for example reach farther when stone roads are placed its a lot too on the left upper corner what does the second icon mean next to the dollar sorry for the negativity really the one time you have all positive news you still use propaganda you can do a trade route to a computer player so you can for example sell cannons directly click your island and then the chosen one and you can sell so you dont have to transport and such you can trade infinite amount of soap with prison wheres all the syphilis oh and the slaves cmon its 1800 i need immersion how about naming your new colony rapture dem and molisher together there the demolisher ship names the only thing i dont like about this as that all the series keep getting mixed up for reason how to import stuff from old world to newhelp raptor you have red pepper on your main island bro no need to plant it elsewhere also you can ask for quests in the diplomacy tab makes it much easier to get them gunboats have their cannons at the front of the shipyou need to move your ships for broadside instead of just pressing attack the beautiful island of the island so much anno im not playing it as much funny that i would rather watch you and pet my puppy instead of gaming he thanks you you have pepper fertility on your ditchwater island man dont waste the resources if you focus on all your residents happiness they will spend more in taxes need to make sure you sell only when trading what about coal take a break bro youve been doing youtube since 2005 and have a total of 38k videos uploading 4 videos a day must take a toll on anybody really damn this ai of the game is extremely frustrating omg i was very agonized in the end with the ship stuck in the rocks if it could not happen you would have chance look i think 5 big ships will not be enough is necessary you to try harder and get 15 ships yes exactly that put 10 for these attacks and keep 5 the rear maybe so you can make it successful the desperation disrupt the decisions a lot if you have more patience and collect 15 warships no one will challenge you you need to get lots of ships now this is how we afraid enemies hehe loving this series raptor the sandbox and the campaign but i think in notifications you can see what other people do etc when you destroyed the pirates navy during that battle the old lady forgot her name had a cease fire you already have red pepper fertility in your current island you need hop fertility for beer production is it just me or does this all look really choppy like the frames completely take away the effect the fantastic looking graphics have 4 episodes in and raptor still hasnt noticed red pepper fertility on the main island by the way artisans dont need the market im pretty sure they will cut my youtube access here on the ship as im watching raptor to get through the day waiting for sandbox raptor i think character items have no use except selling them to their respective owners from the description for some cash and rep they had some similar items in anno 1404 venice so i would try that also keep up the good work ps ive read the description d name for the new town raptorville love your videos of anno 1800 3 im installing d ps im a good boy and i read description why not trade with the prison you keep clicking right over the page ship name the velocity can you build a fleet of like ten ships it will look really cool and you are very strong then do more of this i demand you do more it interesting xd maybe spend sometime making the city beautiful to get people to be happier and pay more taxes also use those brix d uss minnow you know you can group ships right into fleets if im not mistaken wear the sandox one there is also pepper on the main island hey raptor you and your rrpk should play wwz first to say im the 837th viewer you can make the trade route that it will load not just one every time read the descriptionloving the sandbox series i want you so hard to squash warmongering maggie the maggot haha im finding myself waiting before going to sleep for your latest video im australian so its usually not long after midnight you upload no regrets ive waited all day for this prefer the sandbox mode but meh more content the more for me to binge amiraca will suffer like the sandbox series better maybe when this goes on sale i will be able to afford it keep up the good work brother third and hello there raptor second and hi im loving this series so much o3o i love this period of history thank you bro your commentary voice so annoying its unwatchable can you just talk normal used to watch u back in the minecraft days built many houses of ur designs ily keralis did you notice when gasparov bought shares in your island i think you should put up defense cannons on all your islands in case of a attack in the beta i believe you found yourself on the prison island of eli the soap guy buy some of the pirate ships they look awesome and build a cool looking port with a big bertha hey keralis i think youre dust using one of your oil tankers on your new oil route i love your videos so spank you holy shit the three canal reward d d d keralis please make video game minecraft again pearls come from oysters lol i dont know but i love your grids i guess i have ocd aswell keralis you are confusing the lady for 3 episodes you said ok im ur unkle and now ur not again u cant blame the lady for calling you her unkle lol his game seems to have a nice fps yet mine is not confused about this situation since i do think my pc is much better than the recommended set anyone who has the same problem like mine or it is just what it should be after all rimworld somedays we find a guy called keralis boosting the road effectivity wheres cities skylines like this if you want cities skylines you are always so enthusiast i wanna buy every game you play love your videos great episode that empire is coming along nicely you might want to change the name of your main island though i mean egg and ham do not fully reflects the greatness of the keralisian empire d are you going to play subnautica below zero if you conquer someones island the items for zoo and museum in that island sometimes is rare and epic did you check the port harbour storage first if keralis had not stopped those precious few seconds to say i am not your uncle and loaded fewer bananas less clicking time i mean for just the first delivery the ship might have made it back in time p dude expand your navy or youre gonna be in big trouble i hope the next anno game is in the presentanno 2000 please vlog your museum trips in london no but but buts in the episode still love it uncle i am not your uncle is from spy kids its been driving me crazy yo keralis ive been wondering this for a while now and im sure many others have as well will you be continuing cities skylines season 4 i absolutely love the series and i would love to see more can we get an update as to whether youll continue the series the strip club i mean xd me encanta put the museum please i love the smell of you 1355 this is basically my life in a nutshell d anno should merge all of their games so you can just play anno for years while you progress through the ages need this savegame for play rip african queen one of the originals the big editing cuts are a bit disorienting good to see you uncle your industrial area at your main island does not have power powerplant is giving an error notification keralis why you not play anno 1800 campaign another masterpiece from mr keralis love anno serie but wheres tropico mate t get more canals and towers you need to do a lot more structural events will be awesome to follow both anno and now when you started up a new ostriv series love it please bring two episodes per day hahahahaahha so what is the deal with the old and new world i dont rly get it today i learned that the worlds fair building in this game was a worlds fair in london but burned down ive been waiting for you make a video and of coursethe bannana republic too p does anyone else have a problem with their anno crashing een you start the game no dislikes as all things should be oooh 420 blaze it lmfao always wondered if you were 420 friendly d keep making amazing videos my friend on a side note you ever think about the fact that a lot of us have known you now for a good decade or so and feel as though youre a friend even though you dont know most of us at all certainly on odd thing to ponder eh p maybe thats a good topic for you to ramble on one video would be interested to hear your thoughts loving the series man but watching you destroy gasparovs main island trading post was painful in case you dont know the main islands of the npc have a shit ton of legendary and epic museumzooshiptownhall etc items on them that you can loot freely from the trading post once you conquer the islands is the only thing you get besides the empty island once you conquer them buy the pirate ship this makes my day hey keralis i have nearly seen your old house tour will you maybe make a new one i love your videos you are really the best youtuber ind the world but but you just spend all that time removing all those facturies and now you build new ones good to see you uncle this guy travels to every island just to shout this one simple phrase who is he we will never know hes worst to find than waldo you made my evening better thanks keralis also forgot if you ever figured it out but fillaments are the wires inside the light bulb that glow when electricity runs through them as a bonus its a simple matter of resistance that raises the heat along the phillaments temperature to the point of a bright glow which is also why such light bulbs get extremely hot other methods include glass induced such as neon lights and the tube lights in every american office building and school where electricity of relatively lower amounts turns the gas to a hot plasma so it glows or a discharge method where you have an arc of electricity between two nodes that generates the light which is hillariously dangerous but one of the earlier forms of public street lamp since it doesnt burnout normally and is extremely bright cities skylines love this game and keralis omg 3746 look at the top right will you be meeting fans and stuff in london the war museum is absolutely amazing love your vids hope you continue plus could you please build a military harbour for your navy 810 our pearl and oil island next to our nursery and toxics waste island i believe pearls are extracted from oysters not from clamps or shells finally i love this game you are the best

very helpful thank you some people have problems with movement you bounce around too much as you talk and create motion sickness problems oh hello anno 1404 nice 1800th modpack for those starting out new sandboxes you can immediately go claim new land that has resources necessary for you your flagship has everything needed once you claim it no one else can and you can come back to it later when you are ready priceless collect old harold two seconds later harold get off the streets lol is this game worth it if im not mistaken the fishery must be put away from port the trade route will affect the production this game is beautiful you should name the fleet rpt raptor for short glory to raptoria love youre videos i wish more youtubers did playthroughs of anno 4134 thats how russia works what a nice gamer the only reason i have not bought this game yet its becose its not on steam i am not useing other launchers and will not nice video and interesting game its a huge failure they did not include land units they even acknowledged the fans and tried to implement them late in dev but was to late thus its not a complete experience and i decided not to purchase ive been wanting to buy this game but i can find it in steam whats worse the more you want it the more they try and sell you other shit you dont want and end up buying anyways because youre too tired looking for this game i see a pattern here never played this game but it seems similar to tropico definitely looks like a good game to me consider dropping the music volume a bit otherwise great videos very important for our nation to start immediately cutting down trees lolz subscribed d hello was running into problems with tools early game for upgrading in previous anno games is this an issue in anno 1800 any tips on how to manage tools to build thank you love the video btw this game is gorgeous better then the laptop version love it two gun boats called smith and wesson you can call further ones remington and winchester why so many logging camps i failed in the previous games with my indursty any time i tried building that much of anything logging and timber camps are a 11 ratio actually you cant curve the roads funny how you started with booz you spelled wesson wrong lol play the game have slightly less idea how to proceed download mod complete the campaign now starting to see what others doing restart minus mod i dont support mod in multiplayer game only single player this game really takes you away for hours u played it very bad i played about 8 hours and i made 1 million and 6 islands in all over the world anybody else tried to use the middle button to zoom in during the video cool more anno 1800 please this game is hot i really want this game i think a budget 700 pc would be good here just buy a good motherboard for upgrades 5207 its not war its physical discussion its a type of diplomacy really hahahahah shame its not on steam o what would you say to someone whos only interested in the zoo mechanic of this game 2200 this is really close to the soundtrack of banished he has an anno 1800 ep 01 new empire is born released in april 12 2019 and this one also ep 1 april 15 are these parallel gameplays got a questionwhen placing guns in the harbor how do you rotate the gun i want to dont buy any game from ubisoft i warned you they will charge your card and not give you the game if you make a support ticket it will take 39 days to get a standard reply that they will investigate the problem if you look on internet yes i was stupid enough to do it before i bought it you see the problem is there for years why do you think they cancel the steam launch because they would get tons of negative reviews i do not say the games are bad just the platform the support and everything with ubisoft in the name is just pure horror i have a question regarding your pc specs can you tell me that please i still dont understund people who spending time to play something like this if there are not enemies and no fights then whats the point of the game d make city and then d really good song the way you talking about the pigs and the working classgood sir take my pocket watch and my cannon ball like upper body you earned it on a very personal note i like your style no tryhard no overlyanything just a chill guy with a very chill temper one of my favourite youtubers thank you for your content keep it up youre cool love this game but i got stuck on island mission in the story mode i have not played anno game since dawnmay pick this up or just start up a game at times the theme song sounds a lot like the main theme to prometheius and a touch of the perfect storm that was painful your wasting alot there as your building ratios are often way off two sawmills for each logging camp rofl this is so therapeutic i am enjoying watching this specially during my stressful job thank you the biggest challenge is managing money in the beginningyours just replenishes when your outmaking it a freebuild with no challenge his raptoriouss ship hrs raptoria great ship then enemies can shout the rapture is coming and then they all jump ship 1108 thats two cs on that thic lol they had glass blown grenades in the 1800s which were filled with fire exstinguishing liquid so youd just throw it at the fire to put it out its smith wesson not wessen lol no steam no thanks hand blown grenade is a glass ball filled with a soap water mixture when thrown on to a fire will prevent oxygen from reaching the fire removing oxygen from the fire triangle putting out the fire fantastic video cant wait to get my hands on the game and spend hundreds of hours on it why cant i find the game on steam raptor i hope you see this and give a quick answer lol what one should i watch this sandbox one or the campaign give me the one you had more fun on and enjoyed i want it you and everyone else watchin lady its actually so hard to watch this after just recently watching the spiffing brit do a vid on i think version this game lolz very well put together though and regardless of me remembering all the sneaky jobbies spiff got up to with it i enjoyed watching your run through raptor war ship rws vanguard for a bigger ship or rws javelin for a smaller faster one can someone tells me how to move the camera like him i only can move it left and right i cant move the camera upside down like that these are things to make it easier i think but its the opposite when you start the game with a ship you can use the materials in there to immediatly get a new colony 628 when you defeat an opponent in street fighter ii turbo without taking a single hit see my latest video if you would like this game for free and you can thank me later how to download anno 1800 for free on windows pc with uplay see my latest video if you would like this game for free and you can thank me later how to download anno 1800 for free on windows pc with uplay i dont know what it is but i really like your content has me up all night and this series got me hooked sucks i cant play it because i dont have a pc to run it but with you posting that will have to do for now really fun this is so relaxing keep it up uhm its not a nation its a company your part of the english nation as a subject where did you get it i cant buy it in the netherlands why dont u just put 2 brick factories across the road from each clay pits so they dont have to walk so far to make bricks u can use rsp or raptors pack ships for your fleet name that island could have been yours from the start of the game you only need to make a dock there and not make anything else on it d glad to see more views on the channel raptor you deserve it cheers from a unknown swede two cs on that thicc hey raptor the fire grenade was a handblown glass bottle filled with liquid that was thrown on a fire to extinguish it real early firefighting tech whats the diffrence between the campaign mode and sandbox mode the glass grenades were used to put out fires but they were very fragile and dangerous love your video has given me a lot of ideas for my own island keep up the good work im here for anno fuck fortnight also naval action is muh jam raptor i ii iii iv v name of ships glory to the raptorian empire youre posting a lot of anno videos these days im impressed d im only about 20 minutes into this one so i obviously dont know what will happen in the next 40 i just wanted to tell you to be mindful of the time ratio of everything you produce if youre not already aware for example the timber production its a 11 ratio between lumberjack huts and sawmills each takes 30sec so building more sawmills than lumberjacks or the other way around wont really do anything good for your city all the production chains have these time stamps on them so to maximise production it is important to pay attention and build enough but not too many of each thing soo many without further ado mentioned before the game even started but keep it up so is this going to take a thousand dollar pc to play properly america sniff sniff oil is this game inspired from caesar series i have played caesar 3 and i see many gameplay simlarities at first i thought you gonna build an airfield ive kept on scrolling down to zoom in until ive realized its not my game the music is so peacefull for the navy use rrf raptoria royal fleet raptor great vid however you should change the naming style of this new set as it gets confusing with the previous episodes you did some time back also youtube mixes up older episodes 2 3 and 4 as up next ep2 jan 31st then ep 3 feb 1st and then ep 04 apr 14th gets confusing when we need to look for what is coming next try to add something in the title that will link all those episodes to the same story line raptorias revenge ship name and named it on a ship of the line beautiful game but i hate instant build mechanics tropico 6 no where near as good or complex but there is something satisfying about watching your development build up like a real city i was going to preorder but due to this reason im holding of i know it seems crazy but it is a big thing to me might try usr unighted states of raptoria ooh ill finally give a shipisland name now your in the full game and not beta a nice warship name reaper trade ship the murdoch new worldold world trade ship velocity island tortillatopia i cant even watch other people play this haha i was introduced to this game with you ive learnt along with you and now everyone else seems inferior when they do something im like dude hold u or stop building so many warehouses click and drag haha they should watch you to learn how to play it like a pro before streaming dedicated watcher now keep em coming ill be watching raptoria grow more this is my first time visiting this channel and i am impressed i dont play city builders or any other simsstrategy but your video was very entertaining and i ended up watching the whole episode i loved your commentary how you explained the economy the layout of city etc hit that old dreadnaught broadside to the like button congratulations on your new city raptoria looking forward watching your empire to grow prosperous raptor the prefix could be rrs royal raptorian ship is anyone having issues where none of the speech audio is playing correctly for them really wish they had curved roads lol dude count your tiles and that road is a waste of good space anyway i envy u that you could play this awesome game i go back to anno 1404 now you are doing so well with your city planning now two things important 1 when you set up factories do it in proportion to its productivity you can see it on the tag example clay pit makes a clay every 30s brick factory turn a clay into a brick every 60s then make two brick factories for every clay pit 2 get a second large island and put all your farmers farmlands and fishermen there save space for your capital to build factories and get as much artisans as possible to get high tax and free up harbor for future tourist and navy remember make charter and trade routes to deliver agricultural products timbers and for fish from the second island to your capital dude build more warehouses it makes progress faster instead of waiting for every few turns i like to build in 2x4 sqares in the same aqurare design you can have a marketpupfirestation aswell and the design also works good for police station an so on later who wants to see raptor have like 18 gun boats and 35 schooners and just destroy that girl lmaoo will any episodes be streamed on yt i love seeing people help you in the comments and i really hope us telling you we enjoy the vidoes really actually motivates you cause we really mean it thank you raptor hi raptor when u start a new city can u name it firetopia rrs royal raptorian ship what is sandbox i need you to push out like 4 episodes a day haha i love this game not on steam xd can someone tell raptor that the woodsawmill ratio is 11 rrs stands for raptorian royal ship boat name raptarion raptearion raptor love watching these anno series keep them coming finally the real deal hail raptoria guys please dont support ubisofts manipulation pulling the game off steam last minute to spur preorders it worked and sponsoring pretty much every youtuber to positively cover the game also worked dont buy if you can squeeze it in there the big open space inside the roads between the pub and fire station near the northeast marketplace would be perfect for a zoo you are the best at this like before watch this game is awesome i will just eat mud and save money for it there is an album called anno1800 by dynamedion amazing work really here is a link for you httpsopenspotifycomalbum5dvo7wkqohr0ul5jhfirprsihiujuc45r9sazszbehj6eq whats up raptor intresting gameplay coming up i see can you name a ship with the name ace i have a perfect name for one of your

second island right from the start 9h till release on steam did you know you can create fleets this way all ships stay together love everything you do thanks again hmmm good ship names octavia or icarus for fast military ships that soar like eagles where others may stumble and fall the iron ram raptors shadow the hand of justicemidas bane of light or dawn breaker for stronger heavy hitting

thank you kind sir awesome start to anno 1880 you could designate your fleet rns raptoria navy ship could you name one of the future ship after my city kuching anno everyday please dont have a pc and

see it hail raptoria for ship names vulkan vicious viper i should be doing stuff but you keep uploading these vids real life can wait d edit hand blown grenades were one of the first types of fire extinguishers its just a glass ball filled with water when a fire would break out someone would just throw it at the base of the fire to try to extinguish it i cant imagine they worked very well though welcome to our sandbox playthrough of anno 1800 tough times ahead as war looms over raptoria soon we shall be victorious wait its live for you already still not available on steam for me should be another day or within a day right ship names i already asked for one in one of the beta vids the good ol bob wow you are pumping them out man keep up the good work ohh new series oh amazing 1st again bro it needs nvidia ansel unquestionable nice review btw the campaign is lacking pretty hard has to be that weird mergingsystem shame cuz the rest of the game really is the best theyve ever put out there how can you review a game in 2 minutes can that even be called a review more like a overview lol or a preview or a first impression how am i as a consumer supposed to make a well informed decision in buying this product based on such a shallow review i may as well read the description of the game on the ubisoft store page great job on this review i appreciate the short but sweet approach been a big anno fan for years and having played the open beta a few days ago 1800 feels like a victorious return to form for the series at least in my opinion the class requirements is interesting and fits the theme and adds just enough spice to the anno formula for returning players that it makes things interesting looks awesome thanks for the upload first yay quick do something cool uhhhshucks n jives for everyone can u win in this game or is it survive as long as possible kinda way anyone here remember empire earth you start out as a cave man and work thru the ages it was hard but so much fun this sounds very similar to tropico 6 which i really enjoy i may have to try this out why is it only a shit epic bring it back to steam reminds me of ceaser 3 loved that game terrible review you barely talked about how the game is or the way the game is played and focused mostly on a very small part of hte game for most of the video what is the song in the background sorry if you guys can hear that banging my girlfriend is beating me chicken i lold hard on this part buy it its his game of the year guys damn you got me hooked and havent started yet great video shallow as a puddle of piss lol to each their own of course and i do agree theres a good game in there somewhere what i take issue with is your assertion that it is a user friendly game after telling us at the start of the review that you spent several hours studying youtube videos to get to grips with it thats not what i call user friendly for myself i was engrossed when i played the game for several hours straight but in the end the debt spiral got me what really soured my relationship to the game was when i started to go into the red the game informed me that there are many ways to get out of debt but completely neglected to mention what even one of them might be it started to feel like that a large portion of the gameplay was letting the player figure out how the game works for themselves and frankly i think thats a bit shallow damned if i can remember who but someone else called this their favorite city builder too i have to wait until i get a good machine again to run this but its definitely a buy i have anno 1701 and its still a blast mostly for the same reasons mac cites here he may not have explained clearly that you can trade items that you produce on your island for things you cant produce for example if you have iron you can trade it for wool or whatever at least thats how 1701 worked you dont need to produce everything you need if that makes sense looks like a fun game and being i love that era of unchecked capitalism its up my alley only down side i doubt my hp laptop could run it very smoothly yes you say all this but to what end that is why i dont like this game lol bananas what the fuck ive never seen a banana before you sir are funny thank you mac good videos as always best game review ive seen in ages haha oh poor developerspublishers so sad they need to pay steam so much i bet they will be so grateful if we install that featureless buggy and known for leaking their clients credit cards numbers and their data chinese spyware im sure they will lower the prices at least wait no what a surprise so i guess the devspublishers dont give a fk about their clientele in truth they going with the philosophy give us your money and stfu and eat the garbage we will feed you im honestly surprised that you support that exclusivity shit straight out of consoles and anti consumer shit you used to criticize but hey you have your opinion i will have mine youve got bananas what the fuck are bananas lol this is why i removed this sub he talks crap this is not a full aaa title it lacks any real land based combat its not well rounded anno games are some of the best games overall im still playing 2070 and 2205 i will pick this up soon thanks bitte make a foundation review sir ps love your channel sad that its uplay or epic but i dont like uplay so maybe buy from epic and btw againi playerd 700 houers now and still not getting booringand in numbers i pay so far 0071 cent per houer for that 700 hand that you can tell cheap btw in germany they say anno is a game just for germansmeans other countrys dont like itwhat you think guys guys i just wanna tell uget this wonderfoll game and you will feel the magic allover thereanno was alltime rank 1 citybuilder but i dont like that wordits not just a citybuilderthe other i realy dont likeits anno if you could add something to it would it be soldiers to say invade an island welcome to the anno series no steam no buytrash uplayno buyubisoft fuck offgood i safe moneyby the way is allways the same does this have the editor outside the game like 1602 ad does where you can create your own campaigns setup your islands the way you want and just play it steam is not taking a ridiculous cut they have an effective cut of 25 as most developers generate keys and sell those on different sites and platforms where steam does not collect a single percentage in commission secondly if you thought youtube video hosting is expensive take a gander on how expensive it is when you upload several terabytes a month to a single user epic store will die simply because theyre not taking enough to be sustainable steams profits are hardly more than 510 on the total product price the rest solely goes into pure hosting costs youtube hardly sends me 50gb a month in video uploads and they take what 50 of your ad revenue quit defending this piss poor argument of epic trash developers need to stop acting like children and accept the cost of doing business great video thank you is there any reasonbenefit to getting the deluxe edition or is the standard edition the way to go srry but i just heard anal game throughout the whole thing xd never played but seems like old school simcity snes on steroids and adderall total time blackhole now i need to get it o its not on steam im out such a great game cant wait for another video 712 poppy harlow is angry at this meme the meme gods will take you your narration is savage you just made me buy this game you are awesome keep up with the videos just found this channel and it just sounds like sir davos explaining games to me consider me subbed for me it looks like anno 1404 but with better graphics and bug fixes am i wrong is this like sim city meets total war hahah bananas wtf oohhh ive never seen bananas xd hilarious nah fuck epic store but what if you dont like both epic and ugay omg your narration and review made me buy this game if it is even half as good as you say i will be happy love the passion in your review even though your a mackem i think im a geordie but still let it go and concentrated on your review which has made me decide on getting this game thanks cant find it in epic games but how do you blow up your enemies i hope they release this on steam or gog two launchers are enough for me at 60 and in a chinese shop are you kidding this is the best review i have ever seen good job bug npcs and quest progression stops working game has to end yep bugfixing is really taking a piss at people yes i cant play game too no character speak no announcements no notice if there is fire nothing love your excitement for this game of course anno is meant to be played in sandbox mode its anno 30 is a big cut they provide 30 more services than uplay and 300 more than the epic store consoles charge 30 on top of membership fees mac you are my goto reviewer i am an absolute fan of the anno series and this game was basically a must buy for me but i still found myself coming here to see what you thought of it keep up the great videos ya coop is gonna be awesome until you find out your friend bought the game on epic but you bought it on origin wow went to buy this then saw the price 69 usd thats 110 kiwi dollars for a damn game and its not even the full game thats an extra 30 if you want all the deluxe stuff as well bugger that ill wait for the sales some aaa dont even have lip syncing or fancy graphics no line infantry and musketsboooooo i like anno ive played a few games but i really have to say that this looks like that exact same game again nice game to crack thanks epic make more of these and i will crack every one of them nah its not worth it i bought it and played for a couple of days then got bored of its repetitive gameplay and havent touched it since that was over a week ago waste of bloody money and overhyped game this seems alot like anno 1404 hey mack mack mack oi mack mack im really interested in this game but i wanna hear your opinion first please do a review of fade to silence come on mack i want you to read the words the words the words of the developah hey mack try its predecessors anno 2070 thanks for this i have played the 1404 and the 2205 for hundreds of hours and this seems on par with those and also agree with you that the most frustrating things is search quests never understood why they belong in a game like this buts thats my only complaint about the series all else is beautiful stable engaging and relaxing at the same time it looks nice but every time i see this sort of game i think ive seen it 100 times before always the best review videos on there every time im not sure about a game i want to buy i look for one of your videos and im dissapointed and all mixed up when i cant find one but i 100 follow your recommendations and im never dissapointed keep it up ahh great now i want to play this game blue byte has a little niche in my heart as one of the few german developers that have been around since i started playing computer games in the early 90s with the settlers and anno series they are essentially remaking the same two games over and over again but who cares also classic move by them the campaigns in anno have always been shit with contrived boring plot lines and annoying voice acting sandbox mode ftw also you can get 20 discount on every buy on uplay as long as you have 100 club points thats why it makes no sense to buy ubisoft games anywhere else than uplay sorry but your oppinion is based only on this anno title for someone who played several 16021503170114042070 this title is just ok 610 8090 of the game mechanic is the same since the first 1603 in some title where ground or airforces available and not just ships war was not only done by blocking the enemy port and sinking ships the last good anno title was 1404 in my oppinion thanks for the review mack love your content im glad this game got a positive review my first anno game was on the nintendo ds and i sunk countless hours into that game the anno series is great have you played frostpunk not buying it until its back on steam thanks mack great review i like your enthusiasm and its obvious you enjoyed yourself while playing this one the last city builder i enjoyed was caesar iv time to give this one a try anno 2070 was my first first anno i liked after anno 1404very good gamei feel i can play this game all daygreat job bluebyte ill stick to 1404 until the price goes down a lot love this game thats some good anno action right theretotally conquered that annolike hardcore pounded that anno like a champ 030 i lot of you are still crying about this not being on steam really i stopped watching at that point screw you i was subscribing until that point and am clicking off now jackass as someone who is a long time anno player i have to say 1800 is one of my favourites in the series blue byte knocked it out of the park with this one and its a triumphant return to form after anno 2205 do outward mack i have a feeling youre not gonna like it but do it anyway worth a buy no thanks just under 100aud for standard edition ill wait for the bargain bin better things to spend my money on weedcraft inc mack quick tip if you hold down the mouse button when you place houses you can build more than one at a time and use the upgrade tool the same way to upgrade a bunch of houses at once too and when you do the find this person or find the dogs quests from your citizens you can either read where you can find them in the quest charter or click on the quest where the timer is and it will send you to where you can find the person its the easiest quests in my opinion and i rarely spend more than a minute on them usually seconds wow the game sounds way too much like actual work to be a game even though i have spent 100s of hours playing anno i was on the fence with this one but i decided to take the plunge after the positive review and comments my first impressions are that it is better than 1404 and 2070 i am loving it a big thank you to mack and the comments for helping me decide is it just me or does jean la fortune really look a lot like robert downey jr in tropical thunder im convinced will have to play this simultaneously with imperator rome definitely will be buying off uplay im still laughing over meg beating your chicken classic mack this one gets a thumbs up see my latest video if you would like this game for free and you can thank me later how to download anno 1800 for free on windows pc with uplay ok now do levelhead trying to earn the right to buy it but it needs some spotlight no huge fame is giving it attention yet it came out the 18th i think beem waiting so long for it to come out i just know youll love it why cant i just make rum and sometimes trade the extra for other stuff i need like gin and beer mack mac mac mc pac man mac mac mac mac mack mac mac mc pac man mac mac mac mac mack mac mac mc pac man mac mac mac mac sadly i come to late the game isnt in steam no more what a strange move damn sold out on gmg can you not do the whispering echoing thing at the start its super creepy i hate the people spawning in 925 its really lazy programming instantly taken out of the immersion what was the traitor comment about in the intro love it when mac gushes sounds like somebody combined banished with port royale 2 too bad that thats all we got to in 10 years mack you mentioned that steam is still taking a high 30 cut but ive heard that is the industry standard i heard that the microsoft store takes the same 30 as an example if that is true then isnt steam being good by taking the 30 and offering support to those who use their store front like didnt epic even say they cant keep the small they take forever and that it will eventually raise maybe im mistaken but i dont think steam is being ridiculous with their cut if all this is true anyway love the content thanks for the informed reviews 1602 ad was my first pc game the modern annos i really didnt enjoy but anno 1800 took me right back to my childhood fantastic game but be warned this is one of those games that you look down and say shit its 2am i probably need to sleep hey mack is gloria victis worth a buy or not nice positive review mack thank you at last we have a aaa game with no loot crates broken promises over hyped or some other political correctness agenda etc etc as we see all the time in this segment of the 21st century a traditional settlers style game play well worth playing giving hours of fun some negatives as no game is perfect but a game that shines in graphical quality and rewarding your timely efforts a very pleasant change from all those ridiculous prepubescent apex pubg zombie shovelware anthem poor quality manure that engulfs gaming in these modern times ding ding ding oops apologies for my little rant there but yes mack i shall be purchasing this game based on your review and enjoying some quality game time many thanks epic welp sorry lads not gonna buy yer game even if it was worth a buy you dont go epic this is just fact hi mack can you do a worthabuy on forager game looks good the last one i played was dawn of discovery 1000 hours in that game that being said theres no way in hell im going to shell out cash to the epic store uplay isnt any better than steam either so i may just wait for a deep sale a few years from now to pick this one up glad to see that anno is fun to just mess around with again the futureera games were a slog most times that didnt feel rewarding to progress great review mack this i mostly a fan encouraging why to buy the game the critique is missing fun fact when sunflowers studios and max designthe original anno developer was closed many of them merged with bluebyte during the ubisoft takeover so the anno series has mainly been made by the same people since 1998 do i need to sign up for uplay to play this never seen a banana before thanks mack fantastic review glad you enjoy the game as well i played the game in his open beta and i was like at 1 million dollars every minute i had many islands and i really want to play the game but its too fcking much expensive why ubi does that its stupid they looses player because of the price if the game will have a discount ill buy it hello chubby brown given up comedy for game reports hey respect please do wab on a game called dream for ps4 i dont know if hes already done that someone should send pm thresa may a copy of this maybe shed learn how to sort out some trade deals i wanna die with you telling me with your accent do you have any last words no steam no sale talk to me in a year mack you are always very detailed this one takes the cake well done brother so brought today 3hrs 36mins in yes on uplay im having a blast bloody good game and time flys when playing okay mack come clean how much is ubisoft paying ya best reviwer keep up the drugs too ive never rally touched an anno game too but this one looks like it might be my first thank you for the review will there be a seriko before u buy rate need an honest review can i build soldiers and towers to kill the zombies that will inevitably invade now most games wont be release on steam say what you want about ubisoft they are the only triple a publisher who make games i want to play mack is lucky he didnt played anno 2205 would prowably pop a blood vessel worst game in the series this looks like everything jurassic park evolution isnt a proper game for proper people boring as fuck too bad it is out of stock on greenman gaming sorry mack otherwise wouldve bought it through the link as long as you make adequate provisions to take care of riots fires and illness there is hardly any issue with having multiple islands you can pretty much ignore the warnings just make sure the docks are set to sell and over stock of goods im on my 6th new game and i now have city layouts and farm layouts burnt into my brain top tip is to claim as many islands as you can early on you dont have to build straight away just throw down the docks and maybe some cannons i then specialise each island and create a round robin supply route with ships soap and sausages come from one island and supply all the others that also helps keep my main island less polluted and better for visitors later on i have had several warnings from the game for playing way too long though xd i played the first anno game when it first came out back in the last century and it was the best world building game i had played now that technology has moved on and i dont have my mechanic computer anymore just my electric console ill not be able to play this fine game but when i saw that you were reviewing this game i knew you would lap this right up mack i just wish a could get to play it myself it does look great its on epic store so no its not worth a buy thanks mack youre the only trustworthy reviewer fullstop i am at that point in my life where i have the money and energy to buy and play any game i want however i have no time to do it the only way i can enjoy games is with youtube videos i do buy the games in anticipation forprobably retirement anyway i digress i really appreciate your reviews you are up there with the biggest youtubers just wanted to say thank you for helping me enjoy the little free time i have and helping me decide what i buy and hoard who here also had their childhood taken over by anno 1602 ad d it looks and sounds like a city focused version of civilization v does denuvo still mess with your rig no steam no buy i hate the anno games but they are well made and this one looks top notch i wont be buying it cause like i said i hate them but that does not mean they are not objectively good games ubisoft also partnered with epic really liking the campaign for this its slow but it teaches most of the game mechanics well which will be good for sandbox multiplayer praise be mack ive been waiting for this review before i bought it thank you m8 for reviewing it you and exclusively games are the only trustworthy reviewers i listen to anymore thanks mack welcome to the anno series yes they are great im disappointed still no bendy roads curved roads technology isnt there yet you convinced me was always going to be a classic and a wab you smell that you smell that pig shit son nothing in the world smells like that i love the smell of pig shit in the morning excellent game thanks for the recommend i think anno 1800 is for the more experiend players that have played anno 1701 or 1404 game looks great but im still on the first samurai guy in sekiro looks good but im not paying 50 for a game im not a console gamer please can you do a worth a buy video on hellsign its on sale now on steam and looks awesome cheers httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp606500hellsign developer description hellsign is an investigative action rpg that pits you against the horrors of the afterlife let loose on a small town as a hunter youll plan hunt and kill to pay the bills and piece together the fragments to your past just remember a smart hunter is always prepared ive enjoyed this series very much and im pleased to see this iteration keeps all the good bits and improves where needed those find this person in the crowd quests are still around cant help but chuckle at all the hours i spent looking for monks nuns spies and such from dawn of discovery anno 1404 great review mack thank you i thought it was free have you thought about doing a video on the different game delivery companies sure theres a correct term for it but i dont know what it is like steamgreen man gaming etc until you mentioned it id never heard of epic if you can find the time you should try the others in the series as well i have many hundreds of hours in 1404 dawn of discovery and 2205 anno 1404 old but still gold 10 years anniversary in june this year till today considered the best anno title of all maybe this latest one will change it i will definitely go for it this era might not be as cosy as 1404s end of the middle ages but the devs have got better and better and more experienced as well over the course of anno and thus im expecting even more complex production chains and economy management a more versatile gameplay overall plus yet more stunningly looking animated little details everywhere plus last but not least better graphics also of another era 2019 eg what a beautiful shot that was 855 anyways 1404 can still stand its ground it has aged pretty well it kinda reflects what good games looked and sounded like back then when games were once great and not everything was bound to shops and microtransaction hells required internet connections in order to play it and so on and so forth when gamers were still treated like cu great review as always but only managed to see 5min of it and a bit of your live preview but i ragged stopped the video this game is almost the same thing as anno 2205 everything looks strangely familiar too much for a game that costs 70 i learned my lesson from anno 2205 that i bought day one with the season pass the lifespawn of the game was killed by ubisoft with their only interest being the money that they make the first days and from the biggest dlcs that are only released when the season pass expires when this one is at 5 ill buy it because thats the price for a older jacket fitted over the futuristic style of anno 2205 worthabuyragemode off that 30 cut steam takes give comes with a fuck ton of benefits we dont see as consumers and dont care about as customers ie credit card transaction charges creating steam keys at will easy patching process blah blah something to bear in mind while epics gaping yer arse macks not perfect over his youtube career he has made two massive mistakes 1 i thumbed down soma probably the best horror games ever made because how it messed with your mind 2 he thumbed up a game called prey the most dog boring game i have ever had to endure really dont get the epic store issue obvs the metro devs pulling their game was a bad move from them but the epic store itself i have no problem with steam deserves a shakeup cant believe you have never played anno before fantastic games might be worth playing some of the older ones would love to see some wabs on them try pressing ctrl shift r while playing no troll getting it now but is it better than tropico 4 good to see that blue byte are still around after 30 years and making good deep games some credit to ubisoft for not dumbing it down made in germany this anno looks like tropico x banished x patrician if the carrier ai is good im sold thanks for the review mack hmm i was really holding off on this one cause it looked too complicated for me maybe ill give it a try though ugh uplay do they have a refund service if i dont like it is it worth a buyhmmmepic exclusive makes that a big fat no sounds like all the other anno games just with a new skin buy it on uplay how is that an improvement over epic deep as a puddle of piss that im keeping i may even nick the accent for it game is 710 worth only with 50 discount miss many content if you like this better try 1404 or 2070 even this guy agree that campaign is boorings as hell 60 euros for sandbox nah great review mack thanks i always got the impression anno games arent made by english speaking developers so the lip syncing probably fits in the original language and they just didnt bother to make the lipsyncing fit english f uplay and epic i got it on steam those naval battles though anyone else having cossacks flashbacks 024 lol nice jab at america macky i had a bit of a giggle word of warning some people have very serious performance problems with the game i4790k 1080ti and 32gb ram and fps are anywhere between 11 and 50fps it was unplayable for me sadly had to refund not sure if uplay offers refunds just something to keep in mind this is my first anno game as well and once you get you on its hard to switch off its incredible addictive 1602 was my first anno game bought it on ebay big box pc game before paypal existed etc so had to send a postal order and wait about 2 weeks to get it the music in 1602 cant wait for settlers 2019 thanks again mac was really anticipating a good one and the ol thumbs up from you seals the deal the game looks fantastic great review mate you can still get it on steam if u buy the key from g2a wich is cheaper than uplay or epic anyway i like a game that makes you a historical conqueror of the world nice review for those who dont feel like shelling out 60 bucks have a look at anno 1404 which is still great even 10 years after release still looks decent too i support a free market and i want more choices but every game ever made should only be sold on steam loving this game so far been a fan for awhile and this is right up there with 1404dawn of discovery for me been gaming since the 80s and i mainly love rpgs but man this series here is the most relaxing series ever for me i just love playing the sandbox mode for hours and relaxing the pace of the series just hits the right spots for me the previous anno was the only one i wasnt big on this one could be the best yet though soon as time goes by say 2 months i will be buying it but for 20 instead of 60 cause im a stingycheap bad nice review looks fantastic might check it out i have only just recently learned about mack but i have seen plenty enough reviews and holy fuck i dont think i have seen him get this amped about a single other game out there nice finally a game that made mack happy d damn shame it isnt on steam anymore in my country its 60 euros on ubisoft store and 42 usd on epic store for standard edition you know i think these new platforms are just creating a scenario bro meaning when they started they were all like yeah we will just take a smaller cut than steam does so we can make it look like they suck bro its the same shit different day in business creating a scenario in order to get more people on their platform its a shady tactic before new platforms even existed nobody said a word about what steam takes in a the cut so what the hell its just a shady business practice to make yours smaller and call them out for theirs being bigger they will never knock steam outta the game or be better than them so just shut up about it the only way steam will lose is if they sell their company to someone like epic or disney or some other shady as fuck greed filled piss you know what i think i think steam should raise their fucking cut even higher because we love steam and they deserve it for all the greatness they have brought the pc gaming community since thanks for a great review once again great review im shocked that ubisoft didnt flood it with microtransactions like all the other games anno 2070 with deep ocean is my fav do people require bananas to progress even though they have never seen one before thats what frustrated me in other anno games thanks for another honest review mack always look forward to your content i friggen love this video u sir should be voice actor subscribed was on the fence but i decided to buy anno thank you sometimes i question the objectivity of your reviews you obviously are very hard on aaa games but take this one for instance there is a serious optimization issue with this it looks like from your review you either run a potato or the game has performance issues every time you pan the camera it looks like a slide show and i know you dont like that because you have the camera looking down completely vertically on your towns instead of at something like a 45 degree angle because youre trying to limit the amount of content in your field of view thus sparing your gpu you cant even see the buildings from this view obviously its the least aesthetic but yet you dont even address that so are you not objective or did you buy a potato recently where are the slaves in the game would be awesome if they put that part of history in the game too love you mack love your reviews thats it im buying it thanks for the review bought it earlier 6 hours in 236am already worth every penny an absolute fun just like your videos will you make a review about outward did i already watch this video a few days ago play for many hoursleave gamereturn after few daystry to get into things againget fucked will pick this up you know mack i follow your channel now for a loong time and still from all the gamereviews out there cause youre not the only one for my decisions your opinion is the most important for me and gives me my final conclusion although i love to play with gamepads nevertheless thank you for your work time and passion mack best regards from austria roland so anyone thinking about buying this from uplay please take note the purchase can fail in this way you will be charged and the game wont show up in your library then your told the purchase never closed and you have to wait 57 days to get your money back and try again i not the only one dealing with it steam also promotes and markets products on its store they also have the clientele and dedicated users its ridiculous to think they take a massive cut damn this sounds like a dream game and ive never even heard of it i dont have uplay or epicstore though review rome imperator plz this is why i subbed all that time ago your reviews are top notch stuff youve saved me money along with giving me laughter dont ever stop doing this youre great at it edit grammar no thanks ill pass not going to reward epics bad behavior considering what you get for the cut that valve takes cloud saves forum handling refunds etc etc compared to what you get for the cut epic takes nothing i dont really see the big problem you constantly complain about the greed of video game companies and now when they sign exclusive deals based on greed not specifically talking about anno here you are okay with it lol hi mack youre cool you should review outward wow i havent played a game like this since knights and merchants thanks mack great review i know i will sound a little bit ignorant but all those games with this kind of style seem really boring to meof course thats just me bought it anywaybut im glad u like it anyone could have bought it on steam before it came out notice sales of anno 1800 will be discontinued on steam after april 16th due to a publisher decision to make the game exclusive to another pc store the publisher has assured us that all prior sales of the game on steam will be fulfilled on steam and steam owners will be able to access the game and any future updates or dlc through steam we apologize to steam customers that were expecting it to be available for sale after the april 16th release date press ctrl shift r to get into first person mode and this is a first person mode that works really well the citizens feel really alive and react to stuff as it happens around them excellent review mack its good to hear you so happy and enthusiastic about a game o7 finally some footage of the naval action yep this is on the buy list thanks mack great review mack honestly mack you are raving about this game as if it were something really original its not its good but it had hundreds of similar games come before this and the anno series is probably 15 years old now and also as far as city builders go i think cities skylines is better gamers fuck uplay im buying that shit on steam when it comes out media anno 1800 will be epic games store exclusive gamers wtf i love uplay now anno 1602 the best of the series who is waiting for fitgirl its the same bloody game they always make ffs i cant believe people are so stupid that they would keep buying the same game with just minor upgrades for the price of a full game same shit with fifa tropico and countless others fuck these developers and the morons giving them money fuck ubisoft nice that it is return to form anno 2170 was just the black sheep and thx for the review game looks very interesting is it worth tah pirate im playing the anno series since anno 1602 back in 1998 anno 1800 is the 7th one and i always found it brilliant and fun except a couple of bad ones and somewhat underrated and not very well known i hope with 1800 it will get more credit not getting this at day one but definitely there are a couple of hundreds of hours with this game waiting for me down the line this game looks almost exactly like 1701 ad to me but with better graphics of course dont support epic please spinning plates is fun great review mack was waiting for you to do this video before considering picking the game up thanks i bought this never having played an anno game before and i gotta say i absolutely love it spent 10 hours in and it only felt like 20 mins had passed lol you should educate yourself on what steam offers the developer for their 30 cut also if a game sells over a certain amount the cut can go as low as 20 mack who was smacking your chicken when you wrote this good game okay great but where is the 15 saving on epic and the 30 saving i expect on upray this costs a hefty 60 usd minus 1 cent or 70 minus one cent for the deluxe chickenpounder with cheese but that was the fair price when steam gave gamers a say the only reviewers i trust other than your august self and had modding support and was consumer and indyfriendly this is the first wab where i disagreed with you if this is aaa it should be 40 in the poststeam flat chicken nirvana mack i can see that someones whacking your chicken and you should make them stop so you can think straight about whats good for your chickens i mean viewers agreed fun to play game if it was on steam maybe as ismeh great review mac love your work i agree with your comment on games these days its very hard to find something that gives you the value of the money you paid for it theres also very little originality out there as well its a shame seems the best options these days are games that were made with less money rather than more rip chicken hmmmmmmm purchase maybe in order cheers mate choking the chicken gag shall i or shouldnt i alirgtht then wab when you said youve seen a good how to play i thought it would be that vid good channel to watch for helpful strategy game tips always felt intimidated by 1404 but 1800 looks like an hd polished remake of 1404 its a game i read guides for start learning the game with all easy settings on and ill be hooked thanks mack buying this nice aaa hope here most of the anno games are great your street placement deserves a bell mack what the hell are ya thinkin looks like a recycle of anno 2070 im gona enjoy for sure cheers for the good review mack just dont know if it is worth the 50 bc that is a lot of money and im not sure if any game is worth that much ive always loved anno however i cant and wont support ubisoft and their denovo drm bullshit anno lan games were so amazing unfortunately ubisoft had to come along easter egg ctrlshiftr enters first person mode and blue byte thank you for creating an absolute masterpiece hi mack you realy need to check out anno 1404 its an oldy but a great game the gameplay isnt that differend greetz from the netherlands btw i love youre reviews its a shame it runs like cows piss hardly goes over 70fps on my 2080ti and dips below 40 when i zoom in all the way then point the camera at the horizon good review for a good game i wonder how this type of game would play in ancient roman era epic store is cancer and i will never buy a game there even if its the only store selling a specific game i want thanks mak my new goto game well this defo looks like my new time sink cheers for the heads up hms pwnd hms ea sux lol this is a lot similar to ceasar franchise love the music you use anthem anno if you dont like uplay epic or steam wait for the standalone crack solid review im on it like a dog on dropped chips mac while i wanna support the developers i wanna support the consumer more you know cause im a consumer and not a developer now where near worth the asking price not a chance its nice to see you finally play an anno game on here you should give anno 1701 a go its really good this may be the first game i really want to play on my new gaming pc i find my self playing my switch a lot more since im more of a single player gamer itd be great if this was on steam commenting to help you with the algorythm awesome job you do mate good thing i got it on steam before it was removed so this is more of 1404 and it was my favourite anno game mack i was wondering if you are going to review the new upcoming total war game three kingdoms total war and if so are you getting early access to it to be able to give us a review just before official launch or just a week after id love to hear your thoughts on it i bought this on steam the last day it was available there mack your earlier live preview videos on it did help me decide to pull the trigger as it was clear you were having a blast with over 20 hours sunk into it already i can verify that its very addictive in a good way i also havent even gotten beyond the artisan level yet so im still a n00b mac theirs a channel called porkys corner that just does boxing news however he has recently started doing other topics you should it could be a nice change maybe get some new viewers politics is a good one smash some of those bells up stream it you should try anno 1404 it is also really fucking awesome and has aged really well plus it has a cosyness to it love this game so much i even preordered the fantastic soundtrack on vinyl no steam no buy but i will still play it yea anno is amazing but its about sandbox not the missionscampaign another great wab mack looking forward to playing this thx for the nice review i was waiting on this one before i bought it this channel got bought by ubisoft nothing to see here i felt exactly the same about story mode in every anno game it just gets in the way and takes you away from what you want to do great games in sandbox mode though hmm what about the price it is 7999 canadian for me at the ubi store not completely sold on it yet i got really bored by the gameplay and skipped to the last two minutes for the judgement and my opinion completely shifted hi mack will you be doing dirt rally 2 at some point great review mack nice and informative entertaining as always happy easter mate cheers please tell me you dont have to by the drummers as a micro transaction fuck epic game store not worth a buy not worth a shit also your dumbass is complaining about a 30 cut while you constantly shill for green man gaming which takesa 30 fucking cut stupid twat not normally my kind of game but i do really like the look of this i watch people playing it and i get obsessed watching itthe graphics are off the scale it looks stunning not that graphics make a good game as a scot i just see this as i know am i the only one who thinks that uplay is underrated i know this is way off topic but i think it would be cool if mack did a retro review on jagged alliance 2 with the 113 patch since he seems to like squad based tactical games i would have put a negative for the lack of tutorial ive finished the story and im still struggling with things some very simple too like i still cant work out how to make a patrol lol you need to be an octopus with 8 arms to play this game because its not like other city builders there is so much shit too do and im loving it hey mack thanks so much for the your previous videos on anno 1800 i purchased it because i had a blast watching your videos specifically have you remapped your keyboard bindings to use wsad or do you not bother remapping i think you should try anno 1404 and maybe even the more futuristic ones if u like this one that much i never played this so i dont know the degree to which they are different but i can tell you that at least anno 1404 is also damn good and its in a time period that usually fits this kind of games even better the discoveries time as we call them in portugal 14001500 and if u liked the gameplay that much imagine it in space around the idea of colonization of worlds id definitely enjoy watching u mess around with those great review mack i told you this game was huge great game about 20 hours in one gripe is the total lack of info i would love to rtfm but there isnt one lol bought it on steam last week i usually wait for macs review but i got to admit i was trigger happy on this one i am whiner and im going to tell you why steam like it or hate it is objectively the best platform for pc gamers right now sure they take a larger cut from developers but they provide servers advertisement modding workshop drm etc to developers that sell there games on steam the only reason you see games going to epic is because greedy publishers see a cheaper option and dont mind inconveniencing the consumer and their development team in order to make a few extra potential dollars also how can you support exclusivity thats a console word on pc we access our games using whatever librarysoftware we want sold buying it today excellent probably going to pick this up first new game of 2019 first thing thats looked remotely interesting hey mack can u do a wab on kenshi or outward people play anno games on campaign holy shit i could only listen that you have never played an anal game is this a rerelease of the same game title except with new featuresupdated graphics etc i couldve sworn this game came out before the previous anno 2205 2070 games think deja vuidk this is why i love your channel no bullshit or advertising just the bloody truth which is really simple if your giving it a thumbs up im buying it without looking anywhere elsemack i love your channelyour a true gamer there you go a aaa game that the devs knew the priorities love it mack you put the on the cheers and good health and bon apetitooooo hahaha fried chicken yum yum totally agree looks fun but when i looked at it the other day its so expensive ill wait for a sale maybe first time ive played a game like this since settlers when i was a teenager like you mack i watched tutorials on utube beforehand it still took me ages to really get the hang of it but when i did holy crap this is ace nice review mack the transition to the industrial age is so well done when everything is powered with electricity the ships are loosing the sails etc its by far the best game of the year so far d dude this is on steam wtf u talkin bout willis yeah those poor devs only getting 70 lets see howmuch sony takes oops 30 as well i wonder why they still make games for them horrible were you sponsored by ubisoft to cover this game it is an ubisofts game so it is not worth a buy also they need learn to code cpu multithreading is a joke you buy ubisofts games you support shareholders ceo and whole nyse gambling mafia interesting game with a terrible name very happy about this review ive played anno since 1602 ad and have requested an anno review for a while i cant believe at the end you mention you want to start over when youre probably at the midway point of civilizationthere is so much more to uncover at that point and based on my experience it should get a lot harder to grow when you get further on mack i will be getting this and if you need coop players hit me up so why doesnt ubisoft make this an exclusive on uplay doesnt make sense to use epic over steam it looks stunning it really does i loved playing 1404 and 2070 although you needed a really good rig to play them and even then i found that it took several years of hardware iterations for them to be played at their full potential i would be interested to see if 1800 works out the same way hey mack is it possible you will do sekiro shadows die twice if not not a problem at all i fucking love anno spend so much time in anno 2070 already and this yet again an other hugely dangerous time sink i bought it on steam mack you need to try the previous one too where you have to trade with your earth and moon colonies i love the anno games i used to love anno 2070 so this will probably be a must buy when i finally get a pc in 2 weeks hottest video game reviewer on youtube top 1manliest gentleman on gqmagazine list men are jacking off to his voice everday in millions true story that urologist test the potence of men with audiofile old men get to listen his voice over headphone and thin what the heck then suddenly the magic begins is he jesus the question is does he want to be called jesus 5 min into the video and i know i cant leave house for 54 min i am not even ablte to stand up peace out it is the best anno so far id say mack you doing a review of freeman mack you can literally click the quest and it will zoom in on the area you should be looking once you know that the find this guy or animal quests take about ten seconds i have been playing anno 2205 and its funny to see the exact same mechanic here the little squares for the houses the roads and even the maps are the same type anno 2205 got a little dull and a bit too much like work eventually i hope the new one does not can you place diagonal roads i want to feel like the city is mine and not a constant grid system mack my dad is around your age he also says the 80s are the best i just dont see it sadly sekiro shadows die twice is the last aaa game we will ever seen on steam are you forced to have negroes in your city i like the anno series but based on your review i see no advantages to playing this over older versions it looks like exactly the same gameplay for much cheaper you should revisit battlefront 2 theyve removed the loot boxes and pay2win bs and its pretty decent now thanks for the mention a very very good game imo but not worth 80 it was cheaper on steam in my region i will wait for the complete edition until then i will just pirate it great review mack not my cup of tea but will defently be telling friends about it mack have you ever considered being a ux specialist is this on the cancer store hi mack one question do you think days gone will be good i really hope itll be good but i think theyre gonna fuck the game up just gonna wait for victoria 3 for my victorian fix actually it is possible to transfer for example your artisans to other islands so they can work there its available with a commuter harbour when you have engineers sorry for making a accusation half way through the video all cleared up now so far good review fucking hell mack you never disappoint you create honestly the best reviews ive ever seen maybe go beyond games i would love some good bookmovie reviews so its basically just anno 2070 but with the multicontinental gameplay of anno 2205 that alone makes it worth it for me can you review my nan mack you could call it worth a shag gilf edition great game anno meand anus in my language lmao developers on suicide watch thanks mack i was waiting specifically for your review of this summary its a game that can be played by even someone new to the franchise this was my first go at anno which is why i customised the game making it a little more forgiving for myself and i do recommend you tweak it a bit if you are new to the game now however i am ready to up the difficulty and really test myself against the competition aside from the few annoying things like find the missing person quest or the cone shaped navigation marker in the mini map the game is brilliant watching your island grow is so much fun and it all looks and sounds really great its such a flexible game too you can basically do whatever you like power economy or both its one of them games that does not come along very often that is a pure joy to play deep but pretty much easy to play dont rely on the tutorial though its pants i have a linked a decent video in the description that should help great game at really enjoying it is it is it is it lets read the words the words of the developer love you mack at 634 i mention you have to start again when you go to a new island i should have clarified that you do not start the game again but you do start the entire production again on the new island it is ofc a lot easier and faster as you will probably have a lot of materials and money on hand ah yes my favorite ship of the clippers i just laugh when you forget to press trade when you buy at madame kahina you need look all the new world island maybe beryl hidden there wait did somebody sink an oil ship they will pay buy special people that ease work also get museum bars and the zoo raptor have you ever played stellaris i cant believe you havent checked the cloud covered part of the map i would assume she has a hidden island you cant see on the map oh well guess it makes for good content when you have a hidden enemy uss florida should be your next ships name how many more final steps do we have left 4114 5225 beryls last financial holdings when buying goods from traders click on trade otherwise not brought and waste of time check railways are connected seen some not done so will have no oil on them are there beekeepers to make honey its pronounced kaootshoo french for rubber you can make trade routes with neutral traders just like you make your usual routes try to get trade rights with anne she sells extravaganza steamer a 6 slot cargo ship with 3 slots for items they are really cool for expeditions and pirate frigates are much faster than usual ones my military fleet almost completely looks like it belongs to pirates how will you know when you are done with this game raptor beryl is probably north of the island you just took from her you havent discovered that part of the map yet so you cant see what island are there when i knocked her out the queen got her shares 3rd like 15th view first comment been waiting all day for this gamingbolt giving you a robotic cookie cutter description of a game and calling it a review once again anno 1800 the prequel there is no review in this review it is just 8 minutes of regurgitating trailers summaries and anno commercials to be a review the presenter would actually have to have played through a large portion of the game and actually give their personal opinion on what works and what doesnt what has been added and what is missing this has nothing but blas drivel about what the anno community this and long time fans that this review can be summed up as such you can do lots of stuff in this game and its pretty foff you use the word extraneous incorrectly it looks good apart from the lack of ground combat which is disappointing definitely felt like i was just listening to an anno 1404 review seeing you praised it so much at least mention a few differences between the games other than the campaign where 1404 scenarios beat this one by far in 2019 and not a single curve just 90 angles and straight roads this must be a joke they made a 1800 mod of 1404 game and you pay 60 in a chinese shop is this what you call a review you have no talent for this you cant focus on the main aspects of the game trash video a bad review too much information left out in favour of a shorter review so you could do less work in other words lazy maybe you will reconsider your stance in the future on reviews as this doesnt make it enticing to subscribe to you at all so im not too bad i cant map my mouse buttons otherwise i love every bit of this game best city building game ever hard to master do due to the fact that i have like all the islands and cant manage it anymore haha terrible decision to say they nailed the soundtrack its terrible lacks emotional variety boring but worst of all repetitive youll be hearing the same thing for 10 20 100 hours i had to turn it off which is a testament to complete failure because i used to love anno soundtracks i think the sound design in general is bad especially when thinking that in 20 years it got worse placing buildings selecting buildings units nothing feels anno because they replaced all the sound effects with voices these dont reflect the building type but the worker type now a house may sound the same as a factory and a windmill the same as a pig slaughterhouse which is a terrible concept and rips much of annos soul and feel right out of its chest sound matters so much more than most people are aware of and rating it anything close to nailing it is frighteningly oblivious in its current form if anything its an obvious dare i say intentional hole that needs to be patc you talk way too fast without pause take a breath or add more pauses in your cuts and itll be much easier to follow what youre saying show us what youre talking about instead of just showing a bunch of video that doesnt relate to what youre saying use clipgrab to download videos to your pc instead of sitting through ads on monetized channels like this one use clipgrab to download videos to your pc instead of sitting through ads on monetized channels like this one i suggest sandbox mode the tet was annoying you learn more buy sandbox mode anyway i wish you could make ground armies and transport them by ships only reason im not getting it looks good tho i was hoping to hear something more about the game then just the description of the first few campaign chapters is the endgame content interesting and wellbalenced are there different ways to develop your island eg more industrial vs more attractive and does this bring along some limitations or tradeoffs what about conflict how are the naval battles and are there land battles as well is there only the campaing and openended game mode or are there scenarios akin to anno 1404 is the ai any good does it provide a fair challenge while staying true to its character how long does the campaign take to finish and is there room for replayability does the game have enough content to warrant its price or is the gameplay loop engaging enough to keep us entertained for a long time and what about criticism sure the final score awarded to the game is very high but that doesnt mean the game is perfect are there any issues or points that should be addressed before we c trade routes need an in game tutorial or one time walk through badly otherwise good game how does a series peak if subsequent games are rated higher explain this illogic im going to pirate the game because its not on steam how dumb steam is a monopoly and they keep 30 of the games profit if the developers found a way to sell directly good for them was really interested but fuck epic store and uplay steam store close anno 1800 anduplay store open anno 1800 download i wanna play this game but apparently its not available on steam whats up with that and who is this epic games that seems to be strongarming theie way into gaming it sorta makes me not wanna play any games on their platform can u still buy city council seats bored after 2 minutes of listening to this review boring game 50 fucking quid not worth it just play anno 1404 its the same game people should stop complaining about lack of steam support help create alternatives and a healthy competition you goddamn fools played it an hour and graphic is really good beautiful game the campaign is lame sorry but i cant take your review seriously when you build like that too bad i wont be able to buy this on steam anymore which means i basically wont be able to buy this at all cause i aint buying from epic was excited for this then i found out it wasnt on steam shame why are people complaining about this game not being on steam just get it on uplay lol the final verdict i missed it on steam because i thought it would be available to buy all of the 16th oh well i saved 60 euro and there is always the tpb been playing since the release and im having a good time at the campaign took me some time to get used to everything solid 8510 from me im not sure what kind of review this is but i dont see how you can legitimately review a complex and long game like anno in which allot of fine detail like ai behavior trade balance economy are so so important to the long term experience the footage i see in this video doesnt show the reviewer playing anything more then 1 scripted scenario of some sort im sorry but i am not impressed i guess the rush to review is so strong that reviewers dont even take the time anymore to play a game so greedy denuvo and uplay required no steam why is this game not on steam damn it wait is this available on xbox one hows the multiplayer you can get it with 20 less directly from ubisofts uplay store i got mine for 48 u only must use ur golden coins u get from playing to buy a 20 code no review of the ship fighting no footage of it either too expensive for what it is i will buy it in a year i wish there was more variety in the building models turns me off the game this is game is phenominal valve stop being greedy dont take 30 cut on games that pubdevs spent their time and money sadly its not on steam no red pepper fertility lol im pretty sure that should be facility i cant wait till the spiffing brit breaks this sad peasant happy peasant do you think anno 1800 could be as good as 1404 let me know what 1404 feature would you like to see make a return and if you made it to the end of the video red knight or black knight blackknightbestknight get anno 1800 35 off europeuk only httpswwwcdkeyscompcgamesanno1800pcuplaycdkeymwarefrepublic anno 1404 is one of those games ive always loved and even though the game is 10 years old the game still looks fantastic its just sad that there are still some bugs that disappointingly break the game whenever they happen a good example is the memory bug so if you have played one of your sandbox playthrough for a long time eventually the game says it doesnt have enough memory so you need to restart truth is however that the game doesnt recognise you restart the game so at upmost you can play for 10 mins after youve restarted till the message pops up again leaving the game running with this message can and will eventually crash your game if you dont restart still even though this and multiple other bugs exist i definitely think its one of the better annos ever brought out there really is something very charming about the art style in 1404 i love it it is until your game crash because the engine unable to run in 64bit ohhh you really should try out the venice dlc it lets you build a big palace nothing comes even close to 1404 the design the gameplay and especially the soundtrack its my favourite game of all time 1800 is good but it doesnt have the feel of anno i get the farms not needing extra houses and population to make them work as people lived on their farms still do anno 1404 is one of the first games i have ever played and i still play it sometimes anno 1404 is excellent except for the crashes 540 or when you destroy keto ships and get a ton of it fuck this terrible game and the europeans who made it i just bought this at least its not expensive too bad with venice addon there is memory bug which cause the game to crash soon or later no solution can fix this ive been scouring 4x and strategy games looking for just the right one and managed to finally land on anno 1404 1800 looks great but i dont need a 60 game right now just looking at it made me think id found exactly what i was looking for until theres a better sengoku strategy game available man should have bought it during the sale im on the same boat wanted to see 1800 but 1404 seems good and is obviously cheaper anno and settlers are best game thanks for video love it extensively played 1602 was fun back in the days but kinda lost interest in the following titles or found more interesting ones however as you mentioned i only ever played sandbox modemultiplayer never really understood why campaigns exist in strategie games it is far more important to have a multiplayerskirmish mode as this is the bread and butter campaign is usually just the exact same but with weird restriction orand settings that put you against the odds for whatever artificial reasons while skirmishmultiplayer allows you to write your own story create your own settings and this with incredible amount of variety like even back in the days of the first command and conquer i only played the campaign cause they didnt have a skirmish mode just multiplayer and my internet back in the days was garbage at best i was so incredible happy that red alert had a skirmish mode finally i could play the game without stupid mission restrictions and so i did for thousands of h how to win land combat assassins rush as a new annoplayer how have i not heard of it before being an avid civ and aoe player i found this video so reassuring i didnt feel comfortable spending 80 euros on anno 1800 since it was a game i hadnt heard of so i got 1404 venice from steam for 15 euros but kept thinking how i wish i had 1800 instead this video made me realize i bought a real gem and i dont feel bummed that i didnt get the expensive 1800 first you should review 1503 for me 1503 was the best one even though 1602 was my first i play anno 1404 on my laptop and the interface and the map are sooo small the goods are so tiny i cant recognize the symbols what can i do there is no option for that anno 1800 is bantha poodoo next to the masterpiece 1404 tbh i only saw a bit of the video and i had to stop as it seems you are underrating anno 1800 i understand and respect each person opinion ofc but im gona share my opinion so first im gona say the biggest flaws on both games anno 1404veniceiaam 32mod after 8 to 12h of playing the enemy ai simply gives up they stop building making troops ships and therefore they stop evolving if you declare war you can just sit and they wont do anything the max they do is to buy a max of 4 ships each 10min and they attack your trading ships and harbour even if you bring the war to them they will just sit and spam warehouses and towers the ai behaviour is really lackluster and i even included the mod because even with it which makes everything harder even the ai it still lacks the salt if this was fixed anno 1404 would be better than 1800 anno 1800 it lacks terrestrial warfare even tho you had everything to have it lowkey you make cannons and tnt and yet the game doesnt have the anno 1503 have the best combat i just buy the key to the city and take over the whole isle no fighting needed 1404 is far superior splendid thank you republic of play i really need a break from total war for a game thats ten years old it looks magnificent got it today for 999 i was looking for anno 1800 on steam couldnt find it any chance you would do a basic set up city just to show people the ropes your videos are very informative hold on im playing 1404 as we speak but have never seen the interface displays on the bottom center before does it link favoritized ships and buildings how do you do it great now i want to play 1404 again refund 1800 and play 1404 instead its the better game anyway if u like that anno u should really check out 2070 its like that but more and new stuff funny that u think production islands without people is unusual its the opposite for me cause i played all of the series before imagine massive oil plants in 2070 next to citizens i started with 1701 when i was 7 got 2070 with 10 1404 with 12 2205 with 13 and now 1800 with 16 and somewhere between also 1503 i just cant decide which one is the best because the series haunts me through over half my life if its the nostalgia with 1701 or the very cool production chains of 2070 or the objectivly best one 1800 i never really like 1400 that much because it overlaps parts with 1701 and 2070 which i both played before but no doubt that its a good game i played this game for three years without knowing how to get prestige still played it though youre gonna love the venicegolden edition its amazing am i the only one who thinks that 2070 was the best anno it was so beautiful complex with the 3 different factions anno 1404 has some of the most beautifull soundtracks youll ever hear in a videogame 143 are we just gonna ignore the fact that the ship went through the other ship at the bottom left corner i had this game from when i came out back in the days and never really payed it attention now with 1800 that im still consider it is expencive i should try out the good old one good review thx for that very well done review thanks 1404 is the best of the best i still play anno 1404 i cant afford anno1800 i think 1800 will be great i will just miss land combat anno 1800 is 89 here which is ridiculous so imma just buy this while i wait for a sale the most asinine review of 1800 thank you for no gameplay videos or any conversation on 1800 whatsoever sorry you came to 1404 9 years late but how about a review of 1800 would that be too much to ask for a video titled as much does 1404 support widescreen 219 or is it locked to 1610 or 169 considering its so old hi republicofplay is it a fast paced game does it require quick thinking and movement my dad loves civ 5 which is turnbased but hes 75 so not exactly the quickest at moving the mouse scrolled through and i didnt see anyone that mentioned the actual origin game of anno 1701 made by sunflowers which was later bought by ubiby far my favorite but was very excited to see 1800 come out and rollback to a finer age great vid sir 1800 doesnt allow you to change the selling price of your goods fyi anno 1404 dawn of discovery on steam go for the gold version of either game as it includes the venice expansion tried it last night on beta sorry found the game same as the last one turned it off after around 2hours boring what would anno 30k be like during the horus heresy hey check out the venice addon and reconsider it the multiplayer aspect of 1800 lives up to past standards i just love to gather a friend and play anno together with him as one player it is the one thing anno 1800 definitively lacks in multiplayer anno 1404 the games end up in who has the biggest fleet you cant attack on land if you dont have water control xd this is great thanks man 1701 was my first anno and while i liked it i fell in love with the series with 1404 it just oozes charm simply gute deutschsterreichische wertarbeit mine is anno 1503 spend hundreds of hours with that game crazy good keep up the good work man i have been watching your vids for like a year now and i didnt sub until now i always forget too i realized how well your videos have transformed especially your quality and commentating you do a lot of research and get the facts right honestly one day youre going to have a greater following on youtube keep it up if you dont mind me asking i am getting into youtube just finishing uni i want to make tw and other strategy gaming videos i would really like to know what kind of mic and video recording software you use i want an idea for a budget so i can start buying equipment 1404 is a great game i should play it its been so long id have to re install it on my steam really miss the on line anno for some reason they dropped it thats the only anno i have played can you forego diplomacy and just settle the south by giving the vizier a long chat with allah just started playing anno 1701 got it in gog sale should i get 1404 they look very similar i agree land invasions and battles should come back in 1800 you just attack the enemy port and poof you win the island not enjoyable at all especially once you get lots of ships i think i maybe made a mistake playing the campaign mode its plenty long but for i suppose narrative reasons it turns out to be quite a limited subset of everything the game has but it took quite a long while to get through it even so by the end i had had enough of the game to be honest its like i hadnt really played the full experience but by now i was bored with it i still play that old 1404 and the graphics are actually very modern even with a good gpu getting the settings maxxed up is hard im 4 minutes into the video and many things in this game doesnt make sense the fact that you can create a production site somewhere without needing to provide the workers for it thats not how it works in real life thats why it doesnt make sense stronghold crusader 2 did it right nothing new except better graphics same gamelogic as before its fun but not much more fun than the predecessor needs more innovation your voice is much easier on the ears than a lot of the other channels that reviewed anno 1800 i suspect you didnt have anything to do with it but much appreciated nonetheless i think im the only one who doesnt miss the land combat in 1800 you should have bought 1404 venice d where did you buy this game 75 i didnt find it on steam id love to see you take a look at the later games and see how they compare to 1800 too while the games before 1404 were mostly evolutionary 2070 had a few obvious departures and 2205 often felt radically different how does the multiple map feature of 1800 compare to the multiple map feature of 2205 sounds tedious if anyone is going to play anno 1404 with iaam mod i have a mod that needs testing that makes the ai harder late game by default in vanilla they fart out economically all details can be found here thanks httpswwwredditcomrannocommentsalvl8nanno1404lategamehardaimodneedtesters the best annos were 1701 and 1404 the first two were praised by the hardcore fanbase but are really challenging to master anno 1701 ad much better 1404 with brown colors looks ugly also the game forcing you evolve arabic colony no its not now fuck off 605 actually you can pause the game or slow it down theres a subsection in the ui where you can bring up the speed control slow down pause or speed up fuck uplay 1404 is the best anno currently i love it me as a german who has played the anno series since i was 6 or so loves to see that it gets around the world now before it really only was a game series well known in germany totally agree after all those years 1404 is still highly playable one of the timeless games i know besides half life but you need the venice expansion pack get it on steam you cant go wrong with it but beware of the cdkeys and other game key suppliers the key might be legit but not how the gamekeys are obtained heyo you definitely should play the missions they are really really well balanced nice video i really hate the warfare in 1404 i once was at war with an ai about their southern colony but everytime just before i could conquer a markethouse the ai just built anonther one next to it after 10 markethouses i ragequit never played since once a upon a time youtube recommendations brings you a piece of yourself that you never realise how you can relate to it 1701 is also great only played 1602 and it was awesome you can press f1 for a nicer nieuw anno is just hella superior all the supply chain management amazing in 1800 there are not 4 but 5 classes i never really liked the combat it felt clunky to try to get your men on others shores and meh i grew up in 1400s i can confirm that the gameplay in this game is close to how it was irl what an excellent review i spent a few hundred hours in anno 1404 didnt enjoy 2070 but again loved 2205 cant wait for 1800 1404 is very good but has that bottle neck issue of resource gathering where if youre missing one your whole economy gets tanked i like anno but i just wish they could make a proper remake of patrician 3 i know pretty much no one played this game outside of germany and eastern europe but its a really decent economic rts that in many ways preceded modern versions of anno patrician 3 was released in 2000 and had a really unique focus on trade as you controlled a person as opposed to a city who had to climb up the social ladder by trading between the different hanseatic cities and you could eventually progress up to being a mayor of any of the cities in the game from london to novgorod too shame the series died in early 2000s and they only made one more game in like 2010 which was just a remake of patrician iii with crappy 3d graphics how do you maintain a healthy tax income in green mine keeps slipping into hectic reds regardless of how many houses i build how do you maintain income apart from sellingtrading goods if selling good is the only way do you bottle neck all your goods and sell them in bulk or do you do dripsanddrabs also is there no way to speed up the game questions for 1404 of course 1404 is awesome i play it still if 1800 is half as good as 1404 it will be fantastic game i must say i missed more comparison to the new title i know 1404 by heart thanks for reviewing it but did not hear many comparisons to the new one and what i can expect they could have overhauled 1404s land combat for 1800 easybut no they chose the lazy path 1800 will be a no for me if they add land combat in the future then i will buy when 1404 came out i immediately bought and played it as i did with all annos and it was the best so far back then i had absolutely no problems interacting with the muslims down south who were always babbling about allah nowadays it hurts the times they are a changin a few tipps and a glitch your choice if you want to use it you can shrink in the upgrading of the houses in the market if you place multiple norias on a farm you need less fields the glitch if you have an island item you can duplicate it by click spamming it to the island slots what does he mean that you dont need to have the buildings connected by roads and that the marketplace and market buildings are like connected magic chests if i dont connect a mine to a warehouse how am i going to get its goods i have only started anno 1404 yesterday after watching this video but as far as i understand if you do not connect everything you do not get the resource anno 1404 is like amazing the graphics are soooo good like amazing for its time and have aged amazingly how did you manage to zoom the camera out as much as you did in the video to bad you cant get it on steam i always imagined in 1404 that people lived in those farms that they worked in makes sense to me since its how it pretty much worked in the old days i grew up in such a farm after the salazar period in portugal all we had was a small store with various goods which provided everything to various farms around i learned how to read and write in that farm as well as a kid it wasnt until i came to denmark as an 11 year old that i started attending school we are talking about the late 1970s here things have changed a lot in portugal since then holy cow ten years used to love anno 1404 the newer ones just hadnt reached the same level i think looking forward to anno 1800 as it looks promising at least for now i remember playing anno 1503 back in the days i loved that game so much and spent entire day playing it good times and you havent even touched the imperial cathedral and the sultans mosque in other words you havent even seen all goods for the nobles and its drm free on gog great game no issues you havent finished a cathedral have you the game will run out of usable memory and crash wow played anno 1404 for years but i didnt had the idea to turn the camera more isometric like your looks much better like if you want anno 1404 hd edition can anybody shed light on why every anno number adds up to 9 i got the feeling that you played the game without the expansion venice am i right it makes the game even better theres also the mandatory unoffical patch that balanced a lot of stuff anno 1404 is one of those games that will never get old and can be played no matter how many sequels follow it 1800 1404 2070 2205 2 in the past 2 in the future all are awesome its kinda odd in anno 1404 that you dont need villagers to work the fields on your resource islands its cool they changed that in 1800 i never really liked that system there is a borderless window mod and better zooming options as well look for iaam to this day i put almost 650 hours in this awesome game ive played many many hours of 1404 with the venice add on and i never had a full land war maybe a camp or two to get rid of some bandits but that was it i always found it way too pricely to do land combat and i just loved optimizing the production chains besides with the venice add on i was able to buy other cities i highly encourage you to get venice and play cooperatively you can split responsibilities and honestly it feels like it was meant to be played that way the only problem i have with 1404 is that its a massive time sink anyone how is the steam version dawn of discovery not on steam wtf im one of those people who couldnt recommend 1404 enough to you such a good match for you glad you enjoyed it looking forward to anno 1800 content and streams holy shit ive never played a anno game but i remember a wii game which essentially had the same mechanics i forgot the name but holy shit ive been duped by nintendo 350 getting complex if you want to challenge your brain to figure out a game play any paradox interactive game especially eu4 btw this game looks amazing instantly picking it up thanks for covering this can we praise how awesome the soundtrack is 3 i love anno 1404 and i love multiplayer but online multiplayer in anno 1404 only makes sense if youre playing coop if you prefer freeforall online deathmatch mehh it doesnt really work out the same imagine this you see your enemy is about to harass your trade ships with his entire fleet of 3 warships you respond and all you have is 2 warships you lose the naval battle and your trade is cut off within 5 minutes your population devolves because they no longer have spices at this stage youve lost and might as well surrender the problem i have with the multiplayer freeforalls is that it takes roughly an hour to get yourself setup just to win or lose in a 2 minute naval battle as a result i stopped playing 1v1s and freeforalls like i said best to stick to coop me thinking they should expand the combat and make it more varied then realising anno 2205 exists shudder i would advise you to play 2070 as well there is an amazing mod out there called arrc which makes the game even better i grew up playing 1602 ad for nostalgia sake i put the cd into my pc not too long ago to see if i could actually run it on windows 10 i got it to work and damn i got some chills just listening to the music an old favourite of minei come back to it every now and then you might as wanen try 2070 if you like the futher theme more with lots of options saat is amazing me and my friend jarne love the game but my friend sjors hates it and my friend yentl prefers 1404 so warning in advance its not for everybody oh yes 1404 is one of my favourite games glad youve now played it d personally i found the ground combat tedious but you can always do a naval blockade of the enemies main island and cut off his supply of luxury goods then you can watch the population revolt and burn the island for you d sooo who won at the end i hope anno 1800 will add a land combat system anno 1404 combat was a lot of fun once you got the hang of it there was a anno 1404 version for the nintendo ds called anno create a new world i loved playing that yes it was more simplistic and limmited than the pc version but what did you expect from a ds game the key gameplay was pretty much the same and it had its own campaign storyline pretty enjoyable and highely recommend buying it just to have something fun to play while traveling i was thinking about buying it thx for making me want it even more if you like the game mechanics and dont mind it going into a near future era anno 2070 is amazing if you prefer the city building aspect its just better than 1404 although it does have much weaker combat mainly due to the complete lack of land combat although it has aerial and underwater combat and the character may be a bit more corny and a lack of good campaign but just scenario wise its sooooo good 2205 is garbage though 1115 darren confirmed professional anno esports player calling 1404 one of the classics when its the last proper anno game since its predecessors is a little bit far fetched 1502 now thats a classic if you enjoyed anno 1404 try the iaammod it just makes anno even better what are the specs of the pc you use to run this game this looks so relaxing would love to play it raptor please if you are opting you can pause you have 4oil rigs so dats norm ship oiltheres oil on yur capital rraappttoorr 2300 for train you can pause the game dude you ship bricks alcatraz this is sing sing alcatraz this is sing sing bmx we struck oil i repeat bmx we struck oil trains going in 90 degrees wtf that needs fixing by anno too if you love trains join this discord server wed love to have you and talk about trains httpsdiscordggjy3knku you have a ton of coal on the other island how do yoiu manage to zoom that close to look at the trains i can only get the postcard view which brings you in close but not the viewpoint of a citizen great episode lots of good tips in the comments from others hope you get to read them tho i sometimes feel youre not putting a complete strangle hold on your enemies to make the game more interesting if you eliminate the competition then i suppose the game is just a series of developing settlements and technological advancement so maybe it needs a few bad guys in the mix all good fun gonna take me a while to get that farbut love the gamei have them all what trains 1r doing his job and hitting that thumbs up for awesomeness just found ur channel and im loving this series d keep it up if you could just add a powerplant near oil fields so no long routes for delivery and other one in indutrial area that would be much efficient and quicker with overall less materials needed my favorite video made by you is when you did the german convoy defense in mowas 2 and was like its bumper to bumper out here with german medium and light armor i thought it was really funny hello yallyes iam from south usa um i have a question how do you zoom in to ground level in anno 1800 i have seen it done but i dont know how myself thank you and another awesome video sir raptor hi from the philippines simple way to fix your trade problems spam 10 gun boats on one clipperd ineffecient raptor check i want more anno 1800 raptor take out some of the old hags minor islands or she will be back at you with dreadnoughts great videos just got the game but the trade part hangs me up as to how to get started with it great ep its my every day good new and please do some trades routes it will buy you so much time haha you are selling coal thats why your not getting a lot love your vids the progress is awesome you need roads to the oil places you made in case they catch on fire no one will be able to go to it thomas the tank engine is there use the paid trade routes these do not get attacked at all plus its quite cheap ship under attack raptor electricity makes all production running on it up to roughly 300 efficiency or even more so im a first time player of anno and everything was going good had a positive economy for most of the game at one point i was at 10000 with a half million in the bank then i upgraded to engineers and some how my economy completely tanked and went 5000 and lost all my money i had trade and charter routes set up so all my islands were good and got up to engineers and all my supply lines went to shit i would run out of fur coats even though i had furs and cotton fabric in the hundreds and it would stabilize for a little then tank again same with beer and rum but everything would somehow run out before my ship could make it back so i had a yoyo economy where it would go positive by 1000 then crash to 5000 dont know what i did wrong rapwould it be cheaper to put a oil dock by the oil fields in old world and ship it to the other side instead of rail tracks you need to liberate the rest of warmongers islands im here for the secrets so raptor if youre reading this you can set up specific routes by moving the white dots on the screen in order to make your ships avoid certain areas you can save influence points by hiring trade ships to move product this way you can build a larger navy you can make your ships wait until they can fill their hulls to capacity with goods before transport that way theyll be caught by maggies less often you should set up repair cranes at every trade port so that ships will automatically be healed during every trade setting up patrols can prevent your navy from wandering into maggies territory while also keeping her off of your trade ships and simultaneously smothering her navy you can buyout maggies island by clicking the flag in the center of her shares you should smother maggies other islands to keep her from gaining influence and necessary goods shares wont matter for income if you continue to produce weapons and soap and trade them to sarmento and raptor did you know that your main island has oil on it you dont have to import it theres oil over by your grain fields love the series edit i made this comment before you found the oil try to collect the loot from pirates as they could drop a legendary person that makes ships way better what is your creator tag for epic games when war monger meggy keeps attacking your trade routes agh crap here we go again the oil has boosts because of all the oil rigs been waiting all day for this video d thanks man keep it up fyi in the trade unions you can just right click to get rid of someone and left click to bring a new one in no need to drag it to your harbour where is windmills you could produce fur coats on the other island and bring ready items you have 300 productivity because you have 3 oil pumping towers and a bank will help for money you need more mills if you want to make use of the grain buffs u wiil need ship move people to other islands youre the best keep uploading them videos love from israel if you have a charter route between your ilsands you dont need a boat brilliant episode so much achieved oil well done u wanted to know witch building u get jewelry beads in the new world i saw it under the harbour buildings 2400 it is because youve got 3 oil wells hi from spain could you not of bought the oil to get you started raptor you should build guns on your other coast lines to maximise the amount of maggies ships getting destroyed than oil smell good oh no i am turning into usa help me you can use trade all instead of 1 or 10 at a time and it will drop off til max storage is reached first thing by the way i live in toronto and we have a basketball team called the toronto raptors and your channel name is raptor so coincidence second thing oil tanker namescyclops and cyclone and finally like the video and read the description how do you upgrade multiple residential buildings at once without having to click on each single one loving these keep em cming love the content dude makes my whole day thanks again for another great episode of anno 1800 keep them coming you have oil on your main island think its 300 because you have 3 oil well working around the oil building its my birthday great series raptor watch that influence raptor thanx raptor think you really should take out the old witch before she gets thoose battleships the blockade is good but get togheter another fleet and blitzkrieg her minor islands that should really cripple her about the traffic between the old and new world take an island that is close to the point there they move between the oldnew and get alot of big cannons there if you do that you controll all traffic yesss daily uploads and its even in sync with me returning home from school loving the content usa wants to know your location first things

started this game ever go on sale man i was doing so much stuff wrong thanks for the guide man if you want to claim an island that has unique resources how do you know which island has which resources all of these city building games are tainted by absurd models of what would and would not work that are often a direct contradiction of what we know did work you have too many factories and not enough green space oh really lets ask john d rockefeller and cornelius vanderbilt how to grow cities shall we all of these city building games are tainted by absurd models of what would and would not work that are often a direct contradiction of what we know did work you have too many factories and not enough green space oh really lets ask john d rockefeller and cornelius vanderbilt how to grow cities shall we worth a buy brought me here great vid thanks i am currently waiting to build a new gaming pc just so i can play this game wtf was that ending music greed gets you a neg rating too many commercials so my first 10 civlizations all died out in 10 minutes o figured some things out and built a huge empire over the course of 6 hours like chapter 3 carnival came to town and i had the option to sell 5 shares for a ton of sold all 5 got defeatbankrupt screen in 10 minutes no way to get the shares back this game is satisfying aand frustrating af my first anno i almost never leave comments on youtube but im making an exception for this video this is an excellent guide to the game everything is explained in an way that makes sense you got my subscription thank you for making such a comprehensive and enjoyable to watch guide for this beautiful game merry christmas everybody why is this guide essential ill wait so i have been checking up videos for over 3 hours now this is by far the best guide seeing over 10 videos and feeling i wasted time like hell on ppl who couldnt explain simply and keep it to the guide instead of showing off theyre building only thank you for restoring my faith in youtube can anyone tell me how to unequip an item from an equipment slot on a ship i have the trading charter item on my flagship and no matter what i do at the harbor i cant unequip it for mobile users setting up the sandbox 0052 houses needs advancement 0251 population production 0516 harbour goods management 0902 trade routes 1125 items expeditions 1245 the new world 1427 influence 1513 oil trains electricity 1640 disasters outbreaks 1813 shares buyouts war 1951 so ubisoft doesnt have a users manual is there an auto explore option for ships i kinda remember that there was one in the anno games before what is the song at the end around 2305 well done man this video goes above and beyond i subscribed youve made my coffee break a joyful one now i only need a good pc to play the game p outstanding tutorial sir organised and pleasant presentation kudos d started playing this game in the free week and its amazing thanks for all the tips you cleared up some stuff i had doubts about playing it during the free weekend right now and this guide was a life saver bought the deluxe preoder deal and only played it a hadnful of times the need to be online to play single player is bs the constant bugs they create that made it unplayable once they figure out not everyone plays online and that not everyone enjoys bug filled bullshit anyone whos never played a game like this at 1120 thisistoomuch blows off head how is anyone supposed to understand this like the second i understand something then he throws like 9 new things my way i just downloaded the game and im so lost im like 700 grand in debt and my people are trrying to kill me lol i cant believe this game isnt cracked yet need the gold edition now just bought the game and find this very overwhelming haha the song at the end is amazing the lyrics are funny too each anno game is just the same lol so basically this game is just a period piece of sim city my city went broke which city blueprint do you recommend i never comment on youtube for anything but geez how can i not great guide my first city fire within 10 mins me in panic as soon as firefighter building was finally ready wait what the fuck training firefighters ok the last house has burned to crisps sigh this is def harder than anno 2205 47 ais disapproved of this video due to buyout this is one of the best tutorialsguides to this game ive seen so far love your characters name by the way i kept waiting for the next phase of upgrade like mining turns out you need to upgrade a farming house to unlock that milestone lol wasted like 30 minutes just building farm houses its so funny to hear a native english speaker saying schnapps d great tutorial tho really good work great guide especially the table of contents thank you very much stil watching this in october jut bought the game been jumping around from guide to guide and they all fell flat or didnt say anything past what i could already read for myself in the ingame tool tips this though gave me much more clearer instructions and help that went past the basics said ingame thank you etw still is the best great video i love the anno games but if they are not selling on steam they can get lost shit this game looks really complex im not very good at anno yet but man i love the game its so detailed and beautiful thanks for this guide just started the game and i was struggling this cleared up a lot of unknowns great guide thank you tip you have multiple factories producing a resource eg iron to stop production of that resource across all factories hold shift when you click on halt production the double bar all the factories will shut down wherever they are on the island this is a good idea if you forgot where you put them all really professional very helpful this video should ship no pun intended with the game i learned more from this video than i did the entire campaign really loving your guides in general but especially this one the whole influence system completely went over my head during the tutorial do you have plans to do a video about city layouts or general tips as to how one should build huge tip the number one thing that will waste your time as a beginner is banging your head trying to figure out how many consumer goods you need sometimes its crazy unclear for a huge population of 4000 farmers and 4000 workers for instance you need a whopping 14 schnapps production chains and 11 fish production chains and yet just one soap factory needs per resource vary a lot for that reason its insanely helpful to have a basic needs calculator on hand to assist while you build a sense of how many resources your population will need so you can play more proactively and less reactively heres a great tool for just that httpsglkwhrcomanno1800helper its been enormously helpful for me for instance to aim at the resources needed for 2000 farmers 2000 workers right from the start of the game it means you can proactively build the fisheries or anything else you need for that target population up front and forget about it moving on to the next t it really helped me out thank you so much thank you for the great introduction omg theres so much useful information here thank you this will definitely add to my anno gaming experience and improve my efficiencies and understanding of the game thank you for this truly useful primer ive been hemorrhaging cash and now i can see why no war in this one still remember good old 1404 i have no ship wtf can you explain why resource producers have a set limit of fields but holding shift can build more what does building more than the limit effect i think i need a beginners guide this is an incredible guide thank you so there is no infantry thx for i info iam new to the game bought gold edition but played for 3 hours and lost but now i se its not to going and start put buildings here and the so thx for god explaining i vil try again i bought the deluxe version of this game and the season pass the biggest stand out of this game for me is how shit the badly made tutorial is i have no idea what they where thinking when they developed this beautiful beast but it most certainly wasnt newbies to this game i just hope some time soon tm they rewrite the entire tutorial because its pathetically thread bare the campaign is supposed to teach you how to play but its as bad as the tutorial i feel i have to continously rush by farmers buildings and other stuff they need and beautifying the place which in the end runs you into the ground by the time your looking for the dynamite expert on the prison island or just after it archibald gives you a 25k loanwhen your hemorrhaging more than 1k a tick all because i believe the game is trying to rush me as quickly as possible i own all the previous annos but never had so many problems because ive felt rushed and making mistake after mistake which doesnt help because 312 bentes top tip your population get the goods from a market thats incorrect in several ways artisans engineers and investors dont need a market farmers and workers need a market but they can also fulfill their needs without a market as long as theyre connected to the harbor in some way the market is simply a need and not a means to distribute goods thank you for this guide you made it engaging and approachable graphics are amazing im so happy who build anno games they are using new good quality graphics now we can play very well please does anyone know if this game will run smoothly on the microsoft surface pro 6 outstanding review so happy i saw this before i spent 60 on this game great work and thank you are there other games similar to this set in a medieval period this is a crazy fun addictive game i love that you can turn off all the ai and just play alone in sandbox its actually very fun playing with no aicompetitors as a pure citybuilder because there is so much involved in growing your colonies as a pure city builder the game has a huge amount more level of comprehensive details then say cityskylines simcity etcthose games are arcade games compared to anno1880 thank you so much for this anno 1800 is my first anno game and im really enjoying it but the tutorial in the campaign is really lackluster i didnt know just how much i didnt know until i watched this incredibly helpful stuff just watched this well explained video of anno 1800 ive already played the whole campaign and still learned some valuable tips by the way i never comment on videos so yours must be really something anno needs an old egyptian game sort of like pharaoh and cleopatra you forgot to deal with naval warfare ship formations like you said you would exceptional video thank you nice review love it 1880 i can feel my gpu burning even just watching this from youtube your city layout makes me want to puke how do i connect a warehouse to a harbour that is blocked by a river what about when your police go bad on you and start instigating riots when placing a resource gathering building such as lumberjack the game shows the percentage supply of the resource for that placement so for a lumberjack this indicates if the building has enough trees in its catchment see 616 insanely helpfull also i love how your island was set up great video ive played these anno games for almost 20 years and i think just about all of my favorite tips and strategies that i have used over time are in this video plus tips relevant to this version which i am going to start playing soon well done this really is the guide ive been looking for covered all the ground that needed to be covered and in an appropriate level of detail liked and subscribed keep up the good work thanks so much for this guide extremely helpful amazing video thanks ive been stumbling around blindly never being efficient this video set me on the right path wow wish i read this before starting my campaign routing trade routes around trouble spots indicators for depleting resources influence level ups great tutorial and worth a rewatch thanks republicofplay how do i lose money with positive income balance going down with high income from 55m to 105k with stable 58k income help amazingly concise video and im not even finished watching yet nice job blueprint mode is such a great addition to the game 3 this reminds of banished now i say that in terms of gameplay ideas not the graphics fantastic guide ive been playing a couple weeks now and there was still some stuff i wasnt aware of that you detailed would it be possible to infect a ship intentionally send it to an enemy and infect them outstanding thanks a million thank you brofrom your braziliam friend really usefull woah great guide on anno 1800 probably the best one ive watched so far great video can you make roadsrr trackswith curves seeing trains make 90 degree turns is kinda goofy i can also recommend the wiki page for the game full of optimized city and production layouts this looks so good does anyone know when its coming on steam having 30 hours in the game by now and nearly finishing it i always find myself restarting to refine my strategy and applying newly learned skills early on i always find it amusing that although this is a beginner guide i always find myself learning new things from videos like these great vid i played 1602 ad back when it came out i want to buy this game so badly its gorgeous this guide was also amazing thank you so much brilliantly done thank you as i am new to the anno series and i just purchased anno 1800 took me forever to understand the damn trading in this game thank you hey cool analysis and tips i see youtube gave you vp9 codec would you know how many views it takes to switch to that my video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtplq0tbrafwt868s is still sadly on avc and doesnt look as good as yours very good guide i think this game is too much for me i mean i would love to know to play it but to start learning it to play it would take me months so i think ill let it pass anyway i think its a fantastic strategy game thanks for this really good beginner guide please make advanced and expert guides too maybe topicspecific like production layouts with proscons most dont have space for trade unions tips and tricks for playing on very hard difficulty quests expeditions items multiplayer tips etc i would like to see more detail on trade routes like how to set them up the best way how to manage them how to balance resources between islands best beginner guide out there for anno fasure thx i am not sure i missout this portion or not but one more thing we are suppose to take note is the royal tax its not something very huge if you are not those kind of person that likes to build one island for all things means you always expand and all islands remain at a reasonable size if you are like me who likes to cramp as many production as possible in the main island first time playing this game then you might want to take note that after certain numbers of headcount from what i gather is 1000 for certain population class they will start to cause you royal taxes with that said i do not think it is not doableencourage to build mega cities as some youtubers manage to pull it off with huge positive income and 9000 royal taxes you are very good at making a clear and helpful guide i subscribed i aint making no money this game is a trip super helpful thanks you can start a game just with your capital ship and look for a suitable island i always play like that because of the resources the island has so glad i found this guide as i purchased this today and my head was spinning by fifteen minutes in didnt take long looking at this video to see my mistakes thanks the best guide i watch so far thanks for you awesome video what an amazing game it took everything good from 1701 and 1404 and made it better no matter what i do it always says no connection to harbour even tried upgrading to stone roads and keeping house directly beside it is it worth it for 70 youros this was very helpful a very important tip for the midlate game commuter pier after you unlock engineers allows you to transfer the workforce from main islands no more needs to build housing on every island wow this game looks fun do you have a module for setting up a narco republic or ghetto all your inhabitants are alcoholist and require some kind of alcholic drink so keep it flowing someone remind me to buy this game when its on steam so how do you beat the game how does the game end i played the closed and open betas and now the full game i really enjoy it and i still watch tutorials and tips videos to learn things i dont know d i always play with custom settings one or two of the kinder ais princess qing and bente jorgensen are my favourites and no pirates i dont care for the war aspect i just want to build cities i only recently learned about the royal tax which is placed on you if you grow your island population too fast such as getting to around 1000 farmers without upgrading to any workers so its wise to not expand faster than you need to for money saving reasons and do everything gradually i failed a few times trying to upgrade too fast and found its better to upgrade a little workers to artisans artisans to engineers and make sure their needs are satisfied and your trade routes are working properly before expanding more yall sleepin on my boy more subs give him more subs i always wanted warcraft anno 4 races nation builder 1 tip stone roads actually increase the range of buildings like pubs and churches this is an awesome guide great job good job on this i just lost my first campaign and this video will help a lot in the next one now i just wised i could do blueprints and the like while the game is paused really bugs me that the do not have that feature this was a great video thank you couple questions 1 do warships need weapons in their hold from your weapons factories to be able to fire or do they fire automatically once built 2 when you force build over the limit for farms do those extras add any more production to the farm or just for aesthetics thanks in advance how do you create trade routes with mixfleets if i use a clipper and frigate i get an error about mismatched cargo slots does this imply if i use two clippers they will share the same items super informative thank you for a great video now im off to a map restart haha d i hate how they didnt add the orient it was an amazing part of the previous game great guide dude ive watched atleast 5 different ones at this point urs has been the best one whats that song at the end does anyone know what character items are ones that dont have an description on how they are useful like the carriage wheel which just describes that the wheel is form von malching family is there a way to calculate time for trade or charter routes dont buy on epic lmao clowns ive seen many hours of gameplay of this game already and i learn more out of this video than all those suckers combined thanks you should be proud of this video all i know is maggie and eli are both douchebags please make a video on diplomacy and how to make more money highquality guide i appreciate it thanks new to anno 1800 or even anno games generally this is the guide you have been looking for stop looking around for other sources just grab a cup of coffee and watch this from beginning to end this is by far the best i could find clear and relatively comprehensive if it is true they pulled it off steami aint playing it period what an amazingly helpfun video think you can do something similar for rise of industry very similar gameplay and its coming out in a few days is there no negative effects to having more population than there are available jobs you missed the pollution and investors in general that was excellent guides its actually 2 clay mines to one brick factory not 2 factory to 1 mine the mine is 30 sec and factory is 1min will need 2 mines for a 11 ratio ive been playing this game for awhile i was part of the technical alpha and the open beta and really have enjoyed the game play i didnt realize the extent of trading and even shares for the game and your explanation of both helped further my delight in play thank you so much i look forward to more videos from you how do i connect small warehouse to trade post cant complete the task im having troubles keeping my income going ups it constantly goes low then high then low again what can i do to keep my numbers going upwards they need a beginners mode for us slow ones you know im being serious here if you added review to these description of these beginners guides and various other guides i reckon youd get a lot more subs or if youd just dedicate a 515 minute video to a generic review format video youd get so many more subs its ridiculous that a channel of your quality on such a niche but loved segment of gaming which is practically disappearing has only 59k subs i thought youd have 500k minimum by now i guess its your lack of reviews as it were since you do everything else splendidly please consider it you genuinely deserve more subs theres basically you and dtgaming in terms of consistent interesting info on strategy games mostly old in his case and mostly new in your case and a tiny handful of others christ the developers acknowledge youre a worthwhile authority on the stuff how many channels do you think have that sort of respect from the game developers like what 100 at most the days of developers and publishers to actually put in instruction manuals in games is long gone they are even too lazy to put one together in a pdf format it seems they are too busy counting their money from their deep pockets of greed to even care about putting out instructions anymore i miss the days when you buy a game and you get a full instruction book with it i still have a civ3 game with an instruction book thick enough to sell as a novel so helpful thank you love this game the annoseries is highly recommended 1058 so the prison needs a lot of soap hmm mack brought me here that was a lot of helplove the game whos here from worth a buys reveiw very useful info well done at 1155 you are moving waypointers around but i dont have these i need them to avoid bad guys islands graat beginner guide would love to see some more advanced ones this is by far the best anno 1800 guide on youtube no joke i really wish every videoguide was as organized useful and concise as this guide wow good going definitely subscribing fantastic guide i wish id found it before playing 8 hours lol many thanks lets read the words the words from the developer worth a buy sent me here whos here from wab great vid thanks man i needed this video worth a buy brought me here seems nothing new here compared to other annos inovation 510 currently i have 47k population and over 100k income but this was still usefull great video im always afraid of tutorials telling me the best way to play but you did a great job just explaining the mechanics and stuff what tier do i need to get to for a steady 60fps excellent guide thank you oh look a game that doesnt do day 1 dlc how quaint omg how do i change the fucking default view lol such a clear and concise explanation of many of the games mechanics love the little tips at the side too great game and i love the tutorialmission in it but it passes over a number of the things that you explained a highly professional and easy to watch tutorial thank you is the itemduplication bug from 1404 back might make a few things easier in the start once you start working with multiple islands its pretty handy to assign the individual islands to certain resources in my game so far i have 1 capital island where all the houses get upgraded and every job that needs farmers is on separate islands i have 1 island just filled with pigfarms for example wich supplies all my other islands with sausages and soap is this game on ps4 will it return to steam this was just way too much to take in some areas he just went over briefly but they can get deeper its way overwhelming so whats the difference between this game and anno1440 besides the graphics looks like a complete copy paste great video dude please make more advanced one are you gonna play imperator rome excellent guide thank you so much the way you do these guides is fantastic cant wait to see your imperator guides keep up the awesome work so at 620 rop puts a sawmill right next to a lumberjack hut does that not affect the lumberjack huts production output because it is in the area that other buildings would affect the percentage of output from the lh bonus question if you place a lumberjack hut down in a spot that states it will only give out 80 production then will that change the output time of the lh and then the sawmill will receive under its optimal input great guide darren but im not buying because of the epic store bait and switch actually what was not stated explicitly ideal second island should have grain hops and red pepper because after beer red pepper is next resources which is must have with grain player can do beer with hops and with red pepper one can make ingredients for artisans food also potato are nice to have because player can make basic alcohol on island satisfying farmers and workers needs fully which means after a while such island is perfectly stable and no point in coming to it ever again also i find clay to be tertiary on second island bricks are scares true but we can buy those in worst case while beer and canned food we can not another thing it can actually be beneficial to have for example all bakeries in one location that depends on peopleitems inside unions for example one of better union guys is man who make bakeries take grain instead of flour removing one building from the chain completely other is farmer who cut workforce for animal farms by percentage ne this is brilliant man so helpful and well put together this should of been installed with the game great job thanks for this tutorial very well done nice guide fast and to the point it is very rare to see a youtube a video and have no waste time in it subsctibed i am not interested in this game but your presentation is of good quality as always is it possible to manually choose for example which wheat farm is connected to a specific mill got a dude that when placed in a union building made the bakeries not need flour but just raw wheat but my bakery would not get anything delivered due to the farms just transporting all the wheat to the mills making the bakery get no wheat any idea on how to do it if you understood my issue thanks my god thanks for the vid lol quality content as always thank you rop how did you get 1st person is it a mod this is very well put together ive been playing anno since 1701 and i still felt like this was really useful i really appreciate the effort you went to to provide examples of what youre talking about like when you showed the range of the market and the effect on the two different houses you make great guides man thank you very helpful especially you explaining less obvious things like sorting through consumer goods and pointing out the red arrow mean production levels are too low seems obvious but something i overlooked i also had no idea why my income was fluctuating so much thanks i also had no clue the influence tab opened up into a detailed multi leveled menu im 50 minutes in and havent a clue but loving it so far this guide is gonna help a lot thanks my man can you change the price of selling goods wait so the share system replaced the organic selling your goods at lower costs hmm what do you think rop i suppose its more balanced selling stuff net you millions so quickly please does anyone know how to link buildings between each other my sheep farm is supplying wool to very distant sails factory instead of knitters that is very close i have second farm for that but i dont know how to change what building is sending supplies to what building i can see the yellow link when i click on the building but dont know how to change it thanks as much as i like anno 1800 i won t buy it untill it re appeares on steam which it won t due to it being removed sry to say but f epic amd ubi for this thanks beginner tip 1 dont buy it via epic get it on uplay directly or wait for a steamgog release does anyone know what the last piece of music in this video is called or where i can find it if your people get alcohol they will pay you billions i noticed that alcohol gives the most money out of population despite being relatively cheap to produce so i guess any type of alcohol schnaps and beer is a priority i suggest playing on expert difficulty even if you are new the game feels too easy otherwise imo is it me or does the anno 1800 theme sound like the prometheus theme pls no schnapps shortage great vid darren the game reaaaaaaaly looks good been watching you since you worked on tw and you are very good at explaining keep up the good work been meaning to ask you apologies if this has been asked where do you stand with the decision to take the game off steam i am a big fan of anno but being forced to go to other platforms is really anticonsumer for me be it uplay or epic not sure how to react to this as if i jump on the bandwagon of boycotting and not buying then maybe i aided in killing the series not that one person has lots of influence i know but still matter of principle what do you think another fantastic guide looking forward to some of this stuff for imperator 208 bread sausages and beer is this bavaria read description battle cruiser rnr norway keep it up bro love your videos glad people still like games like this this game is pretty awesome more details as compared to civ 6 if they can include an expansion like civ 6 gathering storm

classes for a flagship use names enterprise repulse fletcher or marshall for battleships or cruisers use names sabre yamato argo bismarack trippitz pennsylvania or royal sovereign and for cargo ships use names starlight firefly or transer ill show my age and suggest the edmund fitzgerald as a cargo ship name cargo ship names titan atlas the inquisitor flagship jus make it dreadnautilusignore them

flag ship name should be beasty love you omgg just start the war with the pirate i dont know how they give you the closed beta the dreadnought name literally means that the ship would dread nought as in dread nothing a brilliant name as it was it is a minor shame that the game doesnt match the flow of ship development more closely rather than jumping from wooden to ironclads to dreadnought style a minor shame the game looks awesome this the the dreadnaught yamating reporting in me and my crew are ready to sail under your colors all guns are ready and waiting for your orders cpt iona over an out why arent you using more shipyards read description why do you keep punishing us speaking of boat name punisher you show use charter routes to transport goods you hire someone else to do the

instead of nrf which i assume is new raptorian fleet would it not make more sense to be nrs for new raptorian ship ship prefixes ie hms or uss hisher majestys ship or united states ship refer to ships not fleets flagshippolaris because its the star of the northern fleet and battleship names the empire the fathomthe cougar the pantherthe bloodgood the buffalothe kodiak the tyrant is a badass name for a ship for a flagship or cargo ship nrnlord nelson nrn terror nrn endurance 0145 a dreadnought is a type of battleship with multiple main calibre guns instead of few main and many middle artillery guns the first ship to feature this layout was the hms dreadnought built in 1906 the following type of battleships was named dreadnoughts therefore these ships made the predreadnoughts with medium artillery and fewer main calibre guns obsolete btw on one of the unnamed islands you could build a zoo and call it jurassic park 99 of the time raptor doesnt read the news or messages read them since its the north the names of the norse gods could be cool for the ships odin thor loki and so on ship names rms poseidon rms havoc and rms necromancy smith island new name friendloopeah or new new

love this series a new subscriber senses the 6th episode i wish i could be playing this game with you anyways keep up the great work and wish me luck on my calculus test this friday meeee oooh miiiiih theres a raptor in the sky thanx broo for more anno 1800 cargo ship pegasus read description id love to see another try at this with an economic victory i just bought it in a box for cheaper than online anno 2205 had more going for it a expensive mod of anno 1404 one day i will see curves and non 90 roads 60 for it in a chinese store meh ill wait the year im sure there will be a dlc or 2 by then unless the dlc is also exclusive the giant fantasy machine guns are either oversized gatling guns judging from the donut magazine or hotchkiss revolving cannon a similar artillery scale weapon very popular in the late nineteenth century with every navy worth mentioning and a few that arent triggered gamerz dont realise buying it on steam would be dumb unless if you like double drm truly ridiculous i love epic more and more each day it provides true gamerz tears seems like ubisoft have a some kind of powerfull fragrancy sprayed on his cock no steam no buy sounds great ive heard a lot of good things about the game itself to be honest and it looks like a lot of fun i suppose ill have to either wait a year or sail the high seas epic can suck a diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick i bought the game before it was epic only so i have it on steam kind of lucky because it is a good game which i wouldnt have been able to play if id waited cool ill probably get it on steam in a year if i remember and if i can launch it without uplay ok youve convinced me to pirate it a competent game in this day and age impossible on the other hand as long as developers were forced to work crunch time for years i can imagine that such game would be theoretically possible to develop of course the first anno game that looks functional wellmade and not filled with shitty drm ends up on the egs welp thats one game less i will have to spend money on you lucky basterd i got the division and division 2 and the previous anno game as beta but sadly i had to report a lot of bugs in those and they were not very good games so i did not buy any off them they know i have all the old anno games jet they did not send me this one to beta or to preview i am so sad because this one looks like i would actually enjoy it and be positive about it i am not going epic data mining app so i have to wait a year for this game and probably forget it and pick it up years later for 10 euro on discount steam action season passes is just another word for lazy and greedy wanting to be paid for bug fixing and mistakes or features you did not finish in time for launch that should not be a paid service that should be a basic service for any software just imaging having to buy a season pass for windows updates you would be outraged specially with all the bugs in windows 10 and all the updates that kill systems so i hope this season pass bullshit it is not really epic exclusive since you can simply buy it from ubi soft themselves and there it is why epic shot themselves in the foot by making a deal with them ubisoft has its own store where they sell thier games i am pretty sure that more poeple just bought from ubi rather then epic making this whole exclusivity deal basicly pointless and only denying steam after launch sales nothing more pretty sure itll be better and cheaper in a year when it was day 1 it had a massive amount of issues tbh the game looks too similar to previous anno titles so im not interested i already have those games so why do i need a new one itll ultimately still play the same just with a different progression loop and different graphicsaudio plus fuck ubisoft looks like they understood that anno 2205 was crap i might buy it after all if it returns to steam on sale nice to see it being more like 2070 but i still think the universefuture based thus more freedom of imagination of 2070 was better cool did they say how you can play anno 1800 under linux the tooltips on the production chain view tells you the rate they produce goods each step is 1 to 1 so one unit produced at step one is used to produce one unit at step 2 the trick is the production rates what you commonly see is step 1 produces one item per 30 seconds but step 2 produces one item per 15 seconds this means it takes two step 1 producers to fully supply a single step 2 playthrough i actually would buy this game if only it wasnt a ubisoft game and not an epic exclusive after already being on steam anno 1800 playthrough i enjoy opening uplays game overlay opening a browser page and opening this httpsanno1800fandomcomwikiproductionchains its tedious to keep checking how many buildings you need to satisfy your people but can save you building too many buildings and paying too much maintenance looks good to bad it only comes out a year from now but hopefully it will have the combat put in then guess a year i have to wait arch likes something what is this a fake video hey arch unrelated comment not sure if you will see this but do you know what happened to content creator vaults of terrra the guns at 220 seem to be puckle gun type things do trade with ai to increase diplomacy wait they removed it from steam i didnt know till now wtf where do i cast fireballs and summon daemons is it better than 1404 when arch said goulash for a split second i thought he said gulag if arch is the government and all the profits go to him would that make anno does a socialism simulator lol hahahha arch finaly get let back in to a game and gets free keys so he has nothing bad to say about the game nice man guess you want more free stuff from ubisoft and the best part its going to be mostly bugfree and with more content when its finally released on steam it helps if you also use stonerodes around the houses apart from allowing the firebrigade doctors and police to move faster to where they are needed the stonerode also increase the range of nonproduction buildings like markets churches pubs hospitals and so on also you should always build lots of firestations apart from putting out fires their mere existence reduces the chance of fires and explosions happening with their range in the first place distilleries mines and factories without a firestation or several nearby have a tendency to blow up a lot hmmm best blue byte games i am quite fond of schleichfahrt or archimedian dynasty in english i still like to play it from time to time despite it being a dos game dos box ftw d i remember playing anno 1601 like 18 years ago i really couldnt get to beat the game at that time it was so confusing they clearly improved on that front this game looks so pretty but i rather give the money direct to ubisoft than get a epic account it is shame my computer wont run due to recommended specs the timer on a building shows how long it takes to produce 1 unit of whatever it is it produces so you can compare the production times of the various buildings in a production chain and see how many of each building you need for example potato farms and schnapps distillery have the same production time so the ratio is 11 you still need to guess how much of the final product your population needs and the ratios get less comfortable later in the game i didnt preorder where can i buy it appart from the epic store of course i heard there would be taters none cares about playing a game been with you for years now how bout some lore listen to your stuff every day but its warhammer fantasy lore that stuff is gold got some great topics for you to discuss got faith in you arch hope you havent forgot about us lore guys i wish i was able to play it but epic games wont let me lets play anno 1800 is great too bad im never going to play it because the publisher punished me for being a responsible consumer by not preordering it on steam and i have to use the epic games store if i want to access it now but as i said responsible consumer so basically anno 1404 remake i hope they fix the memory leak from 1404 tbh when can we expect your epic games apology video i really enjoyed piratesthe legend of black kats ship to ship battles no brief interlude for the application of lube quote of the year right there well to bad it doesnt come out for another year maybe make another video once its closer to release and actually comes out does this one still require you to be constantly online in order to access certain features like 2077 did with the ark storage and uplay bonuses the fantasy cannons are probably based on some of the later period rapid fire small bore guns by the end of the 19th century you had things like pompoms which actually look a lot like that for some reason all i can read is it being an artisanal kitchen x3 damn it arch i need to save money for warhammer i bought it already but stellaris sucked me in right before and now im stuck on that cause its wildly complex it seems like i cant wait for spiffing to break this game too good to see some honest positive talk out of you lore master arch wait you download the epic store my faith is lost ubisoft gives arch a key for anno how how did this happen i am legit shocked unfortunately its still ubi and its still epic exclusivity garbage hard pass for me not until i can grab it for a mega sale on steam later or maybe uplay ever since someone cursed me with having that installed on my pc so we can play some coop wildlands what about ground armies i use uplay for all ubisoft games they make you run it for friends list and cloud saves anyway epic games can sugma heretic detected that said i got the division 2 for free with a gpu purchase so i can understand the feels ubisoft they make ok games then try their best to kill them through terrible and invasive support systems looks like a game i used to play back in the game aoe saddlyeven as i loved anno 1404if this one will demand ulay drm to be toleratedrip this ip for my part wich is a tradgedy i still fondly remember bluebytes albion the way the last anno would spoon feed you information on a godlike level was what really made 2205 boring to the point of insanity thats why i keep going back to anno 1404 as you would always have to pay attention to your production as your population grew adding more depth to the game as you needed experience to really excel at the game it would tell you if a material would be in excess or in shortage but never by how much and if your population suddenly mass advanced or grew you could quickly end up derailing your colony entirely if you didnt pay attention have to wait a year for steam release or get a aquired copy elsewhere since epic game store does not accept my money thanks for the vid sir maybe there will be a lets play of this in the future is this out on torrents yet i loved incubation having played it so much is probably why the time limits in xcom2 didnt bother me compared to incubation xcom2 was down right lenient and relaxing and the oneliners and sound effects you could really tell whether your rounds hit the armor or the flesh usually play ubisoft games on uplay anyway buying it on steam or epic seems pointless when i have to have uplay up too the production rate is a little obscured but each building has a production time which tells you how long it takes for 1 unit of the product to be made i had to do a bit of research because i couldnt find consumption rates in game but if you arch or anyone else would like to know how many people each end building supports i have it all mathmetized out 1 fishery supports 800 farmersworkers for instance theres something oddly hilarious about arch saying taters looks good and i like strategy games but ill never go to epic i have been waiting for a new city builder like this im used to waiting for the prices of new game to come down so waiting for it to come to steam wont be to bad from a great distance i have heard whispering battle isle incubation and in that moment i have known in my heart that i have found a brother i love you arch no homo god dammit now im torn between my principles and cool game if only they didnt pull it from steam to be an epic store exclusive oh well anno died for me long ago anyways wtf arch boycott this shit epic games must die ubisoft reached out to you didnt they get a copy of the black list still will never buy because epic dont care not buying epic store exclusives yeah id love to play it on steam these political youtuber anticommunists now get free keys to vidya reeeeeee was anno as big in the rest of northern europe or was it really just germany why do you speak like this i have heard your normal voice man it becomes like sandpaper in my ears to listen to you long term i love your content but the voice makes me mad with annoyance i miss invasion mechanics also also more resources arch you can tell how much a building produce by the rate that is shown in its info tab money becomes quite trivial when you are legit making 500k a second it is not epic store exclusive you can get it on uplay which is all right i just wanted to write that down since arch only mentions it in the end and way too many of you wont watch till that point you better make this a letsplay uplay isnt that bad arch ha arch must has a fan at ubisoft i knew they couldnt be all bad people arch is happy about a new video game this is a good thing newspaper war is now upon us arch go away now if just medieval towns werent built in squares id be in love one of the last internationally important german game production they should absolutely put out a halloween update that replaces the little characters working on your factories and farms with bedsheet ghosts no steam no buy the real question is how does this compare to anno 2205 wait my city is not runed by ghost ok no game for me im glad its cool ill go on the high seas for this one since its epic exclusive what a shame they warned me that the devil would be attractive im getting mixed messages over all from people about the game also anno 2030 the last one combat was pretty much the same just get to where you suppose to go and kill things huh good to hear its a fine product since 2205 was ok and epic exclusivity is a problem only to those who buy at launch ill gladly wait a year for a patche the anno seriess focus never has been on combat as far as i am concerned having a warfarebased expansion would feel rather strange uplay is utter cancer and i will never get a ubisoft game first for chaos and a bit of a psa disregard the part where i said uplay seams less bad since as of this morning i can no longer launch the game from uplay fun whilst it lasted i suppose update the problem appears to be solved now does anyone know the name of the music ive been waiting for months for this game to come out on release ubisoft decides not to release it on steam only on the ubisoft site i dont have any of those paying methods im realy dissapointed and no im not getting a visa card just to buy one game put it on steam so many other people can buy it too thank you i miss the land combat in the new anno so sad whats the song called in the official ost its a shame that this will be removed on steam before i have the money to buy it id rather use my steam wallet than my credit card rumor is it is going to epic exclusive is it true fuck epic game store ano is annus in spanish cant take this game seriously please give me more than 3fps with a 1080 anno 2205 didnt my hopes for anno1800 1 there should be a continous game similar to 2070 in which we are free to do whatever we wanna do with no special quests or special materials that needs to be sourced out i just want materials i can manufacture myself without having to constantly worry about having to complete quests to obtain them 2 remove the goddamn fleet limit for crying it out loud i find it pointless to have a fleet limit i am working on a city in 2070 as i am typing this and the fleet limit are severely hindering my progress i prefer to have one ship for every product i manufacture but the fleet limit does not make it easy for me to have that 3 bigger ships ohhh my god south america love love this game old world factories and new world plantations the sugar and steel in these ports go through trevorwest india industries or they aint going are there any ground military units like it was in 1503 and 1701 like cannons mortars cavalry etc this gonna sux its 2205 with 1800 theme why farmers doesnt eat potato at all cant they have additional food resource giving more satisfaction you cant use all potato to make some alcohol thats unrealistic thing they cant be even named farmers if they eat fish only only windows or macos compatible i loved anno 1404 played it for hundreds of hours but its been ten years and this really looks like a 1404 reskin still with the grid roads im afraid im gonna be disappointed yoo that island at the end looked dope i think the biggest problem with anno is the repetition of the architecture would be good if they could work on some kind of procedural generation to add variety regardless its still a beautiful game anno 10000bc i mean yay ish 19141948 hmm but im more of a anno 1008 vikings style that would be settlers i own all anno games with all dlcs this is just games that feel right to play i loved anno 1503 it was my first and i think it was the best 2205 felt like something else future is great but i want my anno games plus combat mechanics in anno 2205 felt great too bad you didnt make those ships in shipyard like in older versions 2205 had really a lot of qol features that would be welcome in 2070 and 2070 just needed those 2205 qol things to be perfect cant wait so pretty awesome cannot wait 2019 theres lag even in this video but what did anno 2018 look like in gamescom 1800 this better be just as cheap as cities skylines this will be dope what is this someone explain looks amazing hello ubisoft i would like you to come back to ghost recon phantoms it was a favorite game and all the people who played it were so sad they could not play so please renew it if this will be on steam please add workshop i really hope this game comes to consoles alsolooks like it is not though woow looks nice and beautiful 3 is the beast just dont mess this up like you did with 2205 nice one wheres my ray tracing what is the purpose of this game a map doesnt tell me anything about it assassin creed looks cool indistrial revolution changed the world and it all led to where we are now i love anno franchise cant wait for this game finally going back to history another travel simulator is it new version of ac4 bf wow all the time spent on this and yet you still cant get the time to give console players button mapping on r6 siege ubi is releasing trailers can we expect cinematic trailer of ac odyssey im more interested in this then assassins creed odyssey after the last anno i will never buy one anymore what is this it reminds me of that pirate game in roblox ngl played this beta this is my first anno game i loved it and yesterday i bought the deluxe edition would have loved to buy and play this i love these kinda games but i wont because its not on steam and thats a real shame due to the fact the epic store beyond sucks so many questions so little answerscan you have a secret service to kill all those who disobey you p how about making concentration camps for all of the jewish is that possible p can you perform a genocide into that new world of yours look who went to the epic games store good job ubisoft you all must hate you consumers and developers you greedy soulless corporate pigs i wanted to play this but i guess ill wait reviews will have happened by then and trying to threaten people to preorder is scummy after playing the beta as a completely new player to the anno series i can say that i was immediately addicted nice game must have on steam today gl looks exactly like a reskinned anno 2070 020 034 ever heard of britain no steam no buy is this a mobile game i truly hope this wont be rife with paid content nice looking game i liked this video and cant wait to play it yes epic game s store and they took it off steam in an bullshit exclusive deal i need name of actress who telling about this game pleease to bad age of empires 2 doesnt have graphics like that to bad im not buying this anymore cause your taking it off steam no steam no buy 0141 jack bear and wild boar and hunting house plsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss weather events snowfall overwinter cold life struggle and rooster sound and plsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss clearly not my favourite era same as assasssin creed syndicate was slightly annoying for me muddy and polluted world we building kinda wanted more futuristic than anno 2205 or maybe early medieval times or maybe even primal stuff also good idea would be to make anno game from stone age to far future experiencing all eras maybe even online game changing release dates sucks does this game start from early times and eventually comes modern or does it stay in the past as long as there is no damn hencemenn disliked for american accent cant wait for full game ui needs to change imo its ugly and doesnt fit yes their back to the old muilt island system of the older games i will be frank in saying i didnt like the regions thing in fact it lagged me out alot of the time triple aaa games will rise and fall but anno will always remain the kang of city building arent there any natives to colonize and opress i hope this will include the slave trade of course for historical accuracy is this from the makers of tropico raptor is doing a nice series on this now and the dev archived twitch streams are sweet my favorite game of 2019 amazing game with over 2500 quest line voice acting multi player and so much more january 31st already i think i wasnt selected the download is nearly complete my body is ready so excited for this hopefully i can find a beta key ive been selected to play the closed beta there better not be loot boxes in this hmm i dont know why i have a feeling this is gonna be a miss like anno 2205 i really enjoyed anno 1404 and 2070 but watching this trailers somehow does not make me feel anything about the game only i see nice graphics i have just preloaded closed beta i really hope im wrong and that i will like it anno 1800 trials rising far cry new dawn the division 2 i was part of the beta and these islands even the large ones are too small for anything same graphics as the last anno game also just not impressed fingers crossed i get into the beta ive been gaming for roughly 30 years now and anno 1404 is still one of the best and most beloved games ive played so far really looking forward to this can i play as stalin his leadership always amazed me growing up his 70m kd is inspiring will i be able to buy boosts from your ingame store to skip grinds thanks time saver tab was the best feature ever added into a game ubisoft now i can buy a game for full price pay for boost and beat the game in a few minutes best gaming experience ever bring this game to the switch im hyped for a new anno game its about time this totally sounds like mxrs girlfriend lets just hope ubisoft doesnt decide to screw this game with the most idiotic of drm implementations one can hope right trash game honestly looks terrible looking forward to this seems a very in depth game with clever mechanics and stunning graphics to top it off i have been registered for beta test so fingers crossed for that access so excited about thisi should sign for betahope they will choose me d played the last beta cant wait to play it again some of the towns people voices are the same as 2205 same voice actorsget all new ones it ruins the mood other than that i like what i see on keralis gameplay like age of empire that was a great game fix the regional pricing on steam interesting what are the platforms i really like this game that game design d it will only cost you 70 oh yeah yeah dude this is awesome i remember being real young and watching my friend play 1602 ad i know why this sells band in spanish speaking countries perfect i speak spanish and i guess im 5yo sorry hehe ano what everyone thinks of when its stated that the game will return to form anno 1404 what i think of anno 1602 i hope keralis is going to make a series with this one this literally means anus in spanish just with an adicional n the word is ano worst possible name choice yoooo this is epic games store exclusive im not spending a cent on there to get my data stolen hopefully they come to their senses and put this on steam or it gets cracked im interested ill definitely check it out which plat form not really into building games nice game thinks its going to be worth the 60 tho 3715 the fishing boat smashed into your dock amazing game but why are the buildings being instantly built it would be so much better to have the buildings being constructed in a little longer time so you could see them actually being built why do you reject the chinease from expanding there island do they become a threat is they get bigger in the game or is it that shes trying to settle your ialands and thats why this is just an retarded version of anno 2205 do you know keralis i wonder if they will bring this game to console if they do i will certainly buy it i just preordered the game i can hardly wait to play it on my laptop youre like that asshole industrialist governor who forcibly removes people from their generational pastoral lives and makes them move to the city so you can carve up their lands to make a profit how do you live with yourself sir hey how do you win this game or how and when does it end cant stop watching series after series love it pal just subscribed for you hi will this game run on 8gb mx150 the star its poping like an our there another thing is that you can exchange materials from a place to another with a ship so you dont need to worry about the police building if you have 80 brics in the other city hi i would like to play this game please send me a link to download this game or send me the game to emily gsaan663gmailcom thanks please make a full series of this its different compared to what other youtubers are putting on right now im not interested in the same old same old all of them have been playing fps and new horror releases but this series stands out its just chill and reminds me of my child hood playing age of empires and the settlers i love this series raptor please keep it going all im watching now a days is you and failrace because you both are doing different games from everyone else really enjoying this series please make a lets play series i am confident this will be one of the best citybuilding games ever i definitely will be buying when it releases when you had the pub selected it literally highlighted your other pub in white and you still placed them next to each other this game looks soooo much better than anno 2070 just in the details size of models and options for moving editing toolbar cant wait to play it pre ordered this game because of you dude p annoying chinese princess randomly saw the first episode in a side tab looked interesting and i havent stopped watching since been watching it while at work on night shift absolutely loving this series i cant wait till the game releases itd be awesome if you did a series once the game releases will this game come out on ps4 i want a game that looks nice as this on ps4 but cant rly find any dont be rude to my contry raptor im canadian more please love watching these city builders loved this series cannot wait for it to come out why hello there anyone else notice he put a pub right next to another pub at around 1000 more please there is that only one thing that turns me off it just sucks that you can only build straight gridlike roads so this is sim city but old fashioned you really should do a series when the game fully releases after i watched the first episode i was hooked and i subscribed keep it up raptor this series was addictive you got yourself a new subscriber hope to see you when the game is fully released your pc is fucking insane but war must happen at some point before the release hey raptor new to the channel and really liking the series i really hope you do another one once the game is fully released can you show us how to win over the pirates base please put those windmills in the fields it feels wrong to love the things of the world thus it would be wrong do you feel it one more episode plz this is so good would love a play through on release that chinese princess is hot good to see you uncle o7 domination of the waters will suffice yes sir plz a full game with another raptoria really loving these videos man great work so what is the goal of this game is there a military side to the game or an exploration part more of annon please can you name a frigate the war forge wow the music the prison needs lots of soaps coz the prisoners keep dropping them d spuds this a change thank you new sub btw loving the content looking forward to the full series when it releases it would be amazing if games like this were on console and civilization and age of empire or even roma instead of being stuck with cites skylines question will you be able to carry on with this once you get the full game load save games from beta or will you have to start from scratch hi raptor will you be doing an ancient warriors playthrough in dawn of man anytime soon only seen 1 guy play that mode and he was terrible tbh roll on march 1st i cant wait to play it they had trainsrailways in the early promotional material for this game are they still there in any respect back when you were moving the wheat farms the one you did not fill out all the grids for what i would have done was destroy just a few of the dirt roads that go past the windmill or even just one and branch out to the windmills side of the street to use those squares for the last wheat grids thank bud the spud ketchup loves potatos stompin tom connorslast call i would help you move lol love the series didnt say first have i ever helped you make a purchasing decision or enlightened you on an awesome new game you enjoy fan funding and sharing my videos among friends greatly helps to support boomstick gaming thank you i feel like some games require very scripted and concise deliver on explaining their mechanics but with anno i felt like the demonstration method would be the best way to prepare new players looking to dive into a new city builder game what do you think too long too slow let me know thanks deadite why do you waste screenspace by showing your face what value does it add except the negative effect tha tppl stop watching your videos 057 free supplies transfer to trading post and im done those supplies are for a second island bad recommendation imho to much like work how does this compare to civilization series great crash course planning on starting in anno in a few days as a beginner well explained and detailed my last city builder was sim city and transport tycoon will check a few of your videos for guides and reviews i reach artisians level however my buildings and industries dun seem to be making money i started to sell off the excess or should i trade or what can i do to ensure i am making money anno 1800 is free to play this week i gave the trial a shot i liked it and decided to buy the game this guide was very helpful for a new player thank you i am new to all of this ty for the video now i just need to figure out how the marketplace actually works xd im know im posting on an older video but i just have to regarding your comment on changing the headline of the news paper thats what the 1800s most have been like made me laugh the news today either it be paper tv or internet are all politically run its not what they tell you thats a lie its what they dont tell you thats the lie nice video i did pick up a lot from it thanks wow super helpful im broke so i was just able to safely save up and buy the game now i like this kind of casual teacher style of explaining things during the actual gameplay so if youre planning to do any more vids about games like anno or anno itself would be great to see more of similar content i legit cannot win at this game anno is more similar to transport tycoon than to simcity d 3 factories explode in a most michael bay fashion game a fire broke out i lold thanks for the great tutorial i was stuck in this game with respect playing at normal speed is not too slow its perfect for 95 of the time youre playing love how you get straight to the point subbed one more tip the supplies on the boat are enough to start a second island right off the bat preplanning not in blueprint mode shame shame omg love the ending boom from game to logo i really want to play this but the fact that i cant have it on steam is a deal breaker i dont want games spread across 5 different game store clients i found the game pretty cool sort of the graphics are cool but it is missing a few things one is you need to be able to zoom out farther second is you need a faster speed option 2x and 4x is not good enough it gets so tedious as you advance they need to bring back the option of buying seeds for your islands too i do miss the end game mission of building the mosque and cathedral now for the gameplay it is not bad it is not hard to gain allies and do war to wipe out players but if you want to max out technology oh boy you need to work hard just to get steam boats is near impossible unless you crank down the difficulties and even then it is not easy the game is really hard to manage compared to anno 1404 the need for population management can really make it a balancing act between population and resources you need to lay everything out with as little wasted space as possible the fact that your taxes require full supplies that if your supplies get a 1st ship is better to scout for a new island and claim it before ai does this it took me 23 hours to discover the workers tab lol game kept telling me to build shit but i couldnt find where xd great video ty just bought the game and this was a big help sir you ignored the production time of production buildings hence their work timeproduction are not optimised eg each wheat farm requires exactly 1 minute to make 1 wheat but only takes 30 seconds for the flour mill to make 1 flour hence you would need 2 farm for each mill vice versa for mill to bakery but exactly the opposite 2 bakery is required for every single mill hence their ratio is 2 farm 1 mill 2 bakery i liles your explanation to the point fast one the best explaining video games ive seen this far thanks so much i wish you had turned off the music from the game it takes over a bit would you be kind enough to share the map seed good starter video i would add that there is shared storage so if goods are deposited at one warehouse they are available to all other warehouses and to be traded etc the other key point would be to shoe how to calculate how many of each building is needed to optimize the production of different goods but i think you covered a ton in such a short video nice guide i think you have a misperception however which is true of a lot of anno players at 752 when your finances are in the red your solution was to build more farms however you didnt address the cause of why you were losing money so by 1150 you were just losing money again what new players need to be told is the taxes the people pay are related to their happiness not to their needs your farmers were unhappy building more of them just made more unhappy farmers your money went up for a brief time because the new farmers needed a little time to become as unhappy as your previous ones and when they did your finances immediately tanked again what you needed to do was give the farmers their schnapps and a pub once you do that they become happy and your tax income stabilizes you eventually got around to doing this at the end of the video but i think it worth pointing out for new players the solution to money in the red is not to build more farmers playing on easy will allow you to ignore key aspects to the games economy that ship is perfectly stopped so that you can immediately expand to another island more often than not your starting island wont be able to grow hops for beer production that means you need to expand to another island with hops fertility to make that a possibility so you can basically start two cities at once right off the rip can you make the sheep transport directly to the shirt manufacturing building or does it need to go to the warehouse first if you realise lumber jacks are just gonna replant trees anyway anywhere with plenty of space will do thanks for this video it helped a lot thanks for the good vid im super keen to play this now you can play cnn and make fake news haha it a good city builder like anno 1404 not much difference between the two anno 1404 more complicated but anno 1800 more realistic and logic especially for the people needs and happiness boomstick gaming you said to let you know how i liked this style faster teacher covering all basics beginner guide for playing this game im thinking of buying this game which is how i found you searching player content im a old school 33 year old now that grew up as a big aoe age of empires dynasty player i enjoyed playing every game they came out with mostly because ive enjoyed building cool looking towns more then the actual building big armies fighting destroying any all towns in your way to hopefully win i stopped playing with age of empires war chiefs never even got the final asian dynasty upgrade i still play aoe war chiefs for fun randomly though anyways i loved video your style of putting the content together your personality this is the 1st video of yours ive watched but i enjoyed it so much that i subscribed liked this video keep up the great videos my brother you just earned yourself another supporter 3 you dont want to expand to fast early game builds a ton of unnecessary farmer housing my tip is if your income is low dont build a lot of more houses better look on the happines tab in the house and provide what they want the happines stuff like schnapps beer or church give a lot more money from each house 700 farmers and one potato field no way my friend get real is it me or this seemed rushedmade me dizzy very helpful thanks will this come out for playstation looks great but dont have a pc i love how you mention people twisting articles in the 1800s people have been doing that since the dawn of print how do you tilt the camera angle so its not so downward i have been pressing every button on the keyboard and diff combos as well as the mouse functions but nothing is happening noticed that lines appear between buildings when goods are being delivered on your example how do i see this in the game when i play i do not see these lines nor do i see the connectivity or reach of influences from warehouses etc i have just received the game and started to play yesterday thanks for your help add housing when you are already on the citizen count should not make you money the means you have more people than you have jobs real life cities are not perfect either just purchased this game and having so much fun these tips were useful cheers how do you change the orientation of buildings this was great thanks for sharing getting a big banished vibe the fact that anno 1800 doesnt have land battles is a big disappointment you have carnival parades and demonstrations but alas no marching armies city building looks awesome but it would have been sooooooo much better if you could raise an army to defend it maybe next time i learned muchthank you for posting this you are an expert i really like this but im not sure why you felt like you had to speed through and make it sloppy it would of been better if you took your time built it tight and neat you cannot buy this anywhere but the stupid uplay store discontinued on steam and humble your voice remind me a guy making reviews on gametrailer channel how much does it cost on a pc to plat this game yay another anno that just turns out to be massive grid cities how original why u playing faster mode thanks for doing this starter guide it has been a log time since i played an anno game the futuristic ones did not appeal i do have fond memories of playing the 1404 one tho having been used to playing the city builder skylines there you soon realise when watching your video that the similarities are merely superficial thats fine as with around 1k hours in skylines im kinda maxed out on that i would have liked this one to not have the grid building restrictions as well as animation for the construction upgrades of buildings even with just scaffolding it would have looked good rather than a pop build i see also that it isnt citizen focused like tropico 6 or skylines not a complaint just an observation the production chains look good and pretty easy to follow the ui seeming to be simple to navigate in that respect overall the game seems to be worth a buy mine will be installed soon for those who played in the very early beta had much changed w very nice video for a beginner like me thank you this game looks like something i can dump tons of hours into with a guy like that ruling this city im sure they dont need any more sausages just wondering but is it anything like anno 1602 i think it had a sandbox mode where you could start off in the middle with a bunch of cpus and sail out to an island from there you could build up and make an army and go conquer all the other civilizations i was young when i played it 15 years or so ago and i cant remember if that was the one but it looked pretty old i loved that game and it was the only one i ever got to play excited to hear this series is still going and i was wondering if it was anything like it used to be looks good might get this markets should always be surrounded by road that way carts can get around easier and quicker also housing districts should also be surrounded by roads so fire fighters and police can get access quicker plus it just looks nicer glad to see you playing this very addictive what i like the most about this anno is that multiplayer is back that is why the last anno was such a disappointment i dont have any new africa jokes i just love your commentary and your little dog too ship i meant ship honest i like the way that you describe the game looks like an updated version of anno 1701 i love it i guess the ship blessed the rains down in africa 4442 anne harlow dislikes you declaring war on princess qing 5 influence you can sort of drag the farmers houses to place heaps at once it works the same way that mass selecting does as a german i have to say that his pronunciation of the word schnaps is quite funny for those who are interested it is pronounced with a short a so theyve learned at least a little bit from the disaster that was anno 2205 good pravus the coal mine and charcoal kiln produce the same resource except presumably the coal mine either makes coal faster or does not produce pollution really enjoyed your playing style in this would enjoy a short series of this game sweet jesus that inefficient placement of the sawmills congrats with the sponsor there have been bison in the old world fittingly they are called european bison 2344 pravus reminding you hes getting paid click to start the game clicks oh wait beware the bisons will evolve and mutate into grislier versions with the pollution y e s pls play this d 1315 the zoom is hilarious bless the rain down in africa well that ended better then eperus did do a series on this totos gonna colonise africa at this rate im so hyped for this game gotta love how you set out to build a good looking city and then decided to plant the poato farms in the most ocdinducing way possible praise pravus i have tried it liked anno 2205 more also nice to see that you are getting more sponsorships an original toto joke id try but thats something that a hundred men or more could never ever do you should really play this game as a series please do a series on this sometime love your game play 630 got that commie lickwick i was planning on getting this any way i had no clue there was a beta tho i will 100 dowload it following your link so glad you are getting big sponsorships praise pravus so cool do a series on this like you agree bless the memes down in africa 3753 usa wants to know your location gotta love how pravus picked the most imperial looking portrait and then took the syndicalistcommunist flag this game reminds me of house of wolves wow what starcraft map is this p so what the disclaimer basically means is youve been paid to say what they want you to say should not be treated as unbiased so in other words youre just talking a load of bollocks that theyve told you to say thats what you call a fake human being 2256 oh no the ais been drinking again when is plague inc custom scenarios returning bless the rains ive never been much for anno series but willing to give you a watch and add to the view count 1800 why not 1805 insert lenny face here soooo tropico if you stayed with the crown i hear the drums echoing tonight and picks the kerallis portrait what kind of hoi4 mod is this what happened with the imperator rome gameplay haha love your stuff prav i was wondering if you would do a video or not nice to see you with so big sponsorship man your friend is so laid back easy to play multiplayer with and helpful this video is so much better at 175x speed how come i cant see this on steam its very interesting i need to get this game you need more wheat farms ahhhhhh hey man its bruno from portugal we made a cossacks video together a few months before cossacks3 came out d hope to play again sometime back to the roots 3 this better be better than their 2205 garbage impossible to get excited with how the previous game was i need it ich bin so hyped thank you very much for playing shut up and take my money d das wird wieder ein richtig gutes anno nobady comment im first i thing its now my turn im the fckng fiiirrrrsssst you can just click on any production building and on the bottom right button you can see the supply and demand of the individual product on the island do i need a uplay account for anno stop using propaganda totally that is what is decreasing happiness and increasing riot chances to help you in finding if you have buildings when you over above the icon in the chain production popup it will tell you how many of them there are on that island it does not helps you in finding where they are but at least you know if there are some to find you have antifa problem in the old world you should make an island where you max the attractivness you will have legendary specialist this way we need moar anno boiiii think you always should mobilize the firepolice stations when its this bad for only money you get more units for a while correct i thought you totally forget about your old world hahaha not seeing a lot of glory to raptoria comments at the tophmmm salute 07 glory to

the road to 100k goes ever on dont forget to hit those like and share buttons also were trying to get there by my birthday on june 9th so dont forget to subscribe and ring that bell so you dont miss a video the problem is that epic games focus is different from the other platforms they see their customers as developerspublishers and the product are gamers in contrast the other platforms see gamers as the customers and the products are the games the former provides no benefit whatsoever to gamers whereas the latter does thats why this exclusive nonsense is occurring epic games knows that their ideology provides nothing of value to gamers so the only way to get them to purchase there is by limiting the options gamers have this is absolutely anticonsumer and creates an environment of false scarcity whats worse is that other platforms like steam could fight back by attempting to use exclusives themselves sure none of these services cost us like individual consoles do but this would deevolve into a bitter fight where games could be on one platform one day and the next on an entirely different one its chaotic and causes problems for pc gaming in its entirety i think epic store exists and developers flock to there is because two factors 1 whistleblowers like you which is nothing wrong at all but it highlights how 2 gaben shouldve moved his fat ass and start repairing steams reputation the lack of curation while letting spywares and malwares in for sale along with intentionally offensive games and also artifact shows how far valve has fallen which in my opinion i will cheer the day gaben dies or the day microsoft buys valve why is epic good for consumers so far were not getting anything and if history is anything to go by gaming corporate history we wont see any kind of benefit so far games that go to epics platform enjoy a bigger cut of the sales whatever that means since that doesnt necessarily translate into more money and consumers arent getting anything but annoyance and hassles id buy this game if it was on steam where my friends library and achievements are it is my platform of choice and i like all the features it has i dont have problem with downloading another platform as much as i have a problem with supporting a platform that isnt bringing anything positive to the table for me all epic has done for me is make it difficult to play some games that id normally be buying on my platform my backlog is vast and not playing epic exclusives doesnt impact me in any way it should be open in all platforms say what you will the bottom line is steam caused me to stop torrenting almost a decade ago epic is causing me to torrent again let that sink in while i can applaud sid for his unmoving position regarding consumer protection the reality is that what epic is doing is possibly the only way to get traction against a giant like steam that said we should all remember two things 1 the exclusive deals themselves are all temporary which is far better than the exclusivity of console games so lets not act like this is the end of the world as some make it out to be 2 epic will not be buying such exclusives forever in an of itself its a temporary tactic to get a foothold in the market and prove to publishers that selling on epic works i predict itll continue for 1 to 2 years if proconsumer actions were all that was required to be on top the gog should have been king of the digital sales by now sadly thats not the case ubisoft doesnt bother me nearly as much as other major publishers since they have been running their own thing for quite a while anyway so id probably just get it via uplay anyway if i can be bothered although at the same time this fragmentation would make it hell to play anything with friends this already killed my interest in borderlands 3 with 2 being one of the few games i played coop with friends a lot i like the cut ratio of epic dont like the exclusives but i dont care that much either not like id be playing games on epics store any time soon anyway until epic has what steam has like gift cards and a decent interface i just cant give any fucks i mean i always wanted to play nintendo zelda and metroid games but i never did because i couldnt be assed to buy another console not a big deal to me can say bl3 change does throw shit in the faces of people who were steaming it up though then again never preorder anything shit changes and big corp only cares enough about customers to not piss off their stock holders so lets talk about that big white elephant in the room epics charges less from devs and publishers something eveyone is saying to be a fair share which will help the game industry so how about the devs and publishers share part of this cut with consumers by charging lower price for games than what they charge on steam they will still make more profit then what they make selling on steam and will give players an incentive to buy on epic store because its cheaper not rocket science by any means just numbers as cold as they can be the games kinda shitty anyways but 60 lol no way check out those horrible character models in 1st person that ubisoft games are a joke anyways tried the beta it was ok but division 2 was free with a ryzen cpu thats the only way i woulda tried that game total shit so like division anno isnt much better my reason to not get this game is that it uses that awful dineuvo sp antitheft protection that seems to screw legit players more than pirates remember how unplayable the new simcity was yeah this is going to be a repeat im skipping this for now my opinion is while exclusive deals are great for companies they will always suck for gamers here is idea companies why dont you offer an incentive to us to buy your game like if you buy this well give you 20 perent off the price or if you buy from us you get a free game or so on my biggest issue with the whole argument is the double standards behind it if youre going to argue that exclusivity is bad or anti consumer because it takes away consumer choice you have to look at how all exclusivity does this people want to participate in mental gymnastics to justify exclusivity in other places while heavily criticizing epic for doing it when both epic and the other places result in the same thing they are complaining about if thats the stance youre going to take to criticize exclusivity then you need to criticize it wherever its taking place whether its first party or third party is irrelevant its irrelevant if valve paid for it or not because both first party and third party developerspublishers are the ones making the decision about where to sell their game and they have that right and are using the funds for development regardless of the circumstance the funds came and in all cases of exclusivity it limits consumer choice of where the i you have absolutely no principle to invoke that would support your declaration of epics actions being immoral you not having a choice that is to be offered to you by owners of an ip is not violation of your rights or an immoral act the publishersdevs are actually the ones that have control over the thing being offered to you and method of its distribution yet somehow it is epic who owns nothing but means of distribution is immoral i have no idea what mental looptoloops you have to make to arrive at this conclusion but it is not in any imaginable way backed by an objective principle or philosophical concept so according to recent news if im right the devs at anno 1800 just gave up epic exclusivity and are instead having a more slightly delayed release on steam by a matter of hours not months i guess they realized their niche title didnt need to piss off their core audience well it looks like if i want this game then i will have to yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me it from some site such as the pirate bay raar epic bad steam had a monopoly for years and now that competition shows up people talk token shit about how competition is good but epic is bad epic doesnt have reviews so its the damn internet google it youtube search your reviews far steam was a monopoly so they didnt need exclusivity contracts epic paying for exclusivity has zero effect on me as a consumer none this tired clickbait topic is beyond dead good i can save some money no matter how attractive the game is i am not support the scumbag epic store i dont buy games on release anymore anyway ill be fine with this if it eventually comes to steam it it doesnt i just wont get to play it ill find something else to play ha jokes on ubisoft i stopped buying their shit sandboxes years ago its hard to watch you make this city is so ugly three minutes of boo hoo you dont like what a private company does and please support me on this other private company what the topic of the video supposed to be i dont know anymore not hanging around for it now no consoles are exclusive to said console any game made ofr pc cannot be exclusive it can be exclusive to a client to run on your pc but you still can play on any pc with min spec hardware of said game this is just youtube click baiting wonder how long warframe will stay on steam i call for a boycott of steam for there shady exclusive games i want all my games on one platform epic because i am a snowflake who gets triggered if i have to use different launchers poor language exclusive as in only i have a pc and again i can get said game also youtuber law looked at epic and steams terms a service and as a lawyer he said epic is actually better because valve forces arbritration on disputes epic has zero community options pc is where multiplayer thrives burnout which is epic exclusive does not even have leaderboards they had leaderboards in the 80s exclusivity is not competition also epic is not competition for steam not even close perhaps one day they will be but it wont be with my help just remember the riots on the streets everywhere when gog had exclusive for system shock 2 probably no because there were any riots most people didnt know that gog even had exclusive for it when it was rereleased gog promoted it as an exclusive release on their site it turned out to have been 1 month timed exclusive afterward when it arrived on steam point pc does not have the distribution diversity you were lead to believe sure pc has about a dozen distribution platforms but steam has unbreakable hold of the pc distribution and that ire very very bad for everyone but steam especially for consumers it can only be challenged by getting more 3rd party exclusives than steam does steam has more exclusive games than all its major pc competitors put together sure they arent paid exclusives but it doesnt make them any more available on other stores only way a digital distribution platform can compete with steam is exclusives and exclusives no matter who has them pc is superior in every way now consoles shit brings their own wars to pc epic is scum i will pirate any and all games i want that comes to epic they will never get a dime from me my 2 hardcore gamer sons or anyone i know personally steam does need to flip is revenue system and reduce it overall to be fair that is true but this hostage games crap is not the way to bring about change when discussing exclusives its important to distinguish between not available on steam and only available on epic anno 1800 is still available on store fronts like green man gaming and humble bundle with codes being redeemed on uplay this isnt the same situation as epic having a monopoly on sales so i have made snared comments now and then to others but truthfully my opinion is i think everyone is missing the big picture forgot or ignoring it it basically is this epic games choose witch faction to side with for the real warbattle that is going on not saying i agree with it but if you want to know what i mean it is a long expression of my belief hey sid bigfry managed to get 10k subscribers while at the same time you got about 400500 feelsbadman ok deleting epic game launcher right now valve did brought titles from other companies when it started when they were trying to kickstart steam beyond its own games before the orange box later they did that again in another way they did buy the rights and incorporated games already in development prior left 4 dead 1 and even portal if im not mistaken portal i get they reworked the concept even more and pretty much restarted from scracth but still left 4 dead was already playable valve consulted and helped on it when it was already in its later stages but that doesnt matter some of valves first titles were brought over just like epic they just werent big titles people were waiting for heck one is a indie kungfu physics game still exclusive to valve valve only avoided doing what epic is doing because they didnt need to do as much there werent other distribution platforms working to compete with heck they did suceed by the same strategy with their game sure much like epic with fortnite at first exclusives only hurt gamers everyone else profits from it epic should be really really careful with what those storewars they started will bring upon them in the mid and long term and so should developers going down that route im pretty sure that we will see a lot more hacks and digital attacks on epic as in the past 12 month were epics user data base was already hacked 2 times if you as a tech company sign up for such a lot of negative press and anti consumer business practices you will indeed face myriads of unwanted attention just as your users will go to pewdiepies place ill be real i dont care about what percentage of sales a publisher or developer gets i pay the same price for the game regardless so as a consumer im concerned only about my convenience multiple game storeslauncherslibraries is an inconvenience to me im sure all hardcore anno fans will buy the game from epic im happy to wait until it hits steam to pick it up whenever that may be ok im calling bullshit ive seen the response from epic ceo tim sweeney admitting what they were caught in with the steam data access its still up on reddit was not intended bullshit it was as long as we can get away with it what else we havent found i no longer like this sid alpha you push and cross link and sell out for your 100k i wont be here to see it unsubbed perhaps make a separate video for your switch to kofi had to stop watching 3 minutes in and no anno 1800 content on an anno 1800 title why the fck do people care where its sold steam takes a huge cut of the sales up to 30 of the total revenue if a company pays you to launch their game on their platform and takes a significantly smaller cut 12 which option would you pick its a nobrainer really i cant believe you call yourselves fans of the anno series and you go bitching about this you literally want less money going to the devs for no reason kofimania is reaching everywhere here is the silly pointless algorithmdefying comment i dont see the millions and millions who play fortnite moaning i dont see the issue every consolelauncher has its own exclusives and anno 1800 is cheaper directly from uplay so just get it from there when are people going to realize the fact that epic has the option for exclusivity doesnt make it their fault entirely the developerspublishers still have to say yes or no to that deal also i dont know if the word consumer applies here due to the fact that you arent consuming anything to sid reguarding the spyware being debunked comment what i have read and heard is that many of us are worried myself included about tencent the company epic is partnered with even though tim sweeney keeps saying that tencent has no imput with epic you still have to wonder about a company with that type of track record especially if you know anything about the ccp i find the hardest things are often very hard not as hard as eating a burger through your nose but still pretty hard youtube algorithms blow donkeys btw in my opinion any game company that gives in to this wasnt worth buying in the first placei dont trust epic too much and not letting players play on the platform promised is literally falseadvertisementsteam has always been shown to care heavily about the customer developers but epic seems to focus on profitsepics lack of diversity will also be their fall i feel like this whole exclusivity thing will backfire on epic could be wrong though so i will try to keep an open mind on it kofi is supposed to be pronounced like coffee its just a fancy way of saying cofinance my coffee basically i dont like exclusives but i understand them and it doesnt really bother me if you really dont want to support epic than dont buy the game thats how you stop this what does bug me about epic is how absolutely crap the store is given their cash flow poor design and just like it was made with my first webstore software seriously these are just games and if someone really doesnt like how epic is doing this than dont buy it until its available on the distribution site you like also let the publishers know why they arent getting your money do this repeatedly like once a day or a week because otherwise you just want to whine about the situation and not try to stop it i used to be a pc gamer but all this shit with epic store exclusives has made me go back to console at least there the console wars makes sense people are confusing platform exclusives with store exclusives the only truly bad exclusives are platform exclusives because they force you to buy extra hardware in order to play a certain game store exclusives are not or at least not as bad as some people make it sounds because you can still use the platform you already own to play the game as long as we end up paying the same prices while being able to use the same hardware that we already own does it really matter where we buy the game from not to mention that in the case of anno we would still have to have uplay on our computer in order to play it even if we purchased it on steam i dont really use any steam feature nor do i take into account the reviews there i always prefer to watch some playthroughs if i have doubts whether to buy a game or not so the lack of reviews on epic means nothing plus considering the mob with torches and pitchforks that is waiting outside they cant implement them any time soon bec remember one thing with large corporations the only thing they care about is money you the consumer are nothing youre a number a cash cow a whale and the only vote you have the sole power you have is with your wallet as long as epic caters only to developerspublishers and not customers i am gonna stick with steam or at the very least purchase a product directly from the companys launcher epic is an inferior shop with not even half of the features steam has its not consumer friendly companies were ok for years with the 30 as it was a stable for everyone yet now all of a sudden people have problem with that as for the pro argument that developers will get more money be real with yourselves the money will go directly to publishers ceos and shareholders not game developers it is literally the same as saying money from loot boxes go toward game development sidalpha if epic offered you 2m to have the exclusivity for your vids would you do it leaving a comment because i want to tell you i agree with most of what youve said in this video ehh nothing lost ubisoft have been crap for years churchill you took that from churchill i like to pronounce it cofee if its not on steam then i aint buying it simple as that i wanna say thats a churchill quote but im not absolutely sure kofi ive always heard it pronounced as kofee or coffee in the future if youre going to start a longterm thing like the patreon rants say that up front so that it doesnt keep getting mentioned for no reason for like 2 weeks yoho yoho its off to sail the hi seas for me shame i was actually planning to buy this if it wasnt as boring as 2205 231 now lets talk about what im actually doing here in regards to this video to begin with hmmm i made this comment on your previous upload i am glad you understood my somewhat of a strangerant comment it was satirical of course but there was some serious thought into it ubisoft turning on epic store will surely see an influx of sales from uplay directly instead of egs kohfee not sure myself lol i honestly have just been doing my retro game thing so this here is not really on my radar i certainly agree with your list of pc gaming advantages and i will add mods to that list as well nevertheless i am a predominately console gamer for two reasons cost and convenience sopublishers have an ethical responsibility to reduce costs and maximize profits as they owe that to the stockholders and to their own employees epic offered a money saving deal and they went to it i dislike the idea of exclusives but theyve been around for a long time as have bonuses for preorders i make it a personal policy not to preorder but there may be future exceptions publishing games is an actual business so real business practices do apply lower costs and maximize profits it also should be noted that ea epic bethesda etc seem to be nonplussed by the virulent criticism they have been getting from some select internet sources they probably realize that the vast majority of gamers 90 do not even watch videos about games or frequent forums etc pu technically console exclusives are done to sell consoles to satisfy the shareholders yeah they are still big jerks paypal does the same thing patreon does better not disagree with paypal 512 oooh ubisoft triple a companies are moving to epic for the chinese market since tencent has a 40 share of epic and can license games in china unlike any other companies outside china so 321 until kofi starts politically banning stuff p how to get idiots to buy your product far in advance make preorder available on their favourite storefront than announce it will get canceled and only available somewhere else the preorders by the schizophrenic people should go through every roof you can imagine it is maybe some kind of sales tactic for the next year maybe two calling a different launcher on the same pc the same as console exclusives is ridiculous the only way steam is going to clean up is if epic keeps this up steam has been able to be lazy about letting garbage weigh down all decent developers simply because any competition isnt really competition this will be a good thing if everyone just calms down simply use a different launcher exclusives on console are not usually a bad thing a developer can make a game so much better in many ways when its only developed for one system most developers prefer to create for a single system its the money behind them that pushes for multi plat edit really like your channel sir i just think everyone might be just a tad overzealous on this one coffee cofire or whatever p about patreon you dont need a lot for being as triggered as the people you denounce interesting maybe at some point youll just stop using internet in the meanime i will continue to watch your video while ignoring your own stance no local currency and security are my main issues with epic for 7 months straight at least a dozen times a month i was getting security warnings on my epic account so i dont trust their security likewise i dont bother buying from websitesstores that dont have my local currency also i honestly dont care if publishers get more money the 30 vs 12 issues when i am still paying 80 or more on both steam and epic honestly i think a lot of the arguments in support of or against all of this are overblown yeah its another launcher to download and install but data storage is cheep yeah its another user name and password to remember but i use a password manager yeah its another security risk but i use 2 factor authentication and when added to all the other risks its a drop in a bucket you can point at the short coming of the epic launcher but its stable which you couldnt say about a lot of these other launchers that have come out and if features were enough to ensure real competition in a market then gog would already be challenging steam the whole thing about timed exclusives well ive got some bad news for you thats already going on right now please do remember that you needed a damn spread sheet to figure out when you got to start playing anthem for the most recent example while what epic is doing is a dick move in a lot of cases its all things that we as i really think all of this is being blown way out of proportion this is not exactly the same as console exclusives is this a good thing this is happening i dont think so is it the end of pc gaming as we know it no i feel like everyone is being overly dramatic steam has had their share of exclusives now that a lesser platform is getting exclusivity now its a problem yeah okay cmon lets be consistent here either its all okay or none of it is if its really that big of a deal you have to use a platform you dont like then dont shop their vote with your wallets i think theres also a way to setup a direct paypal donation system that accepts monthly donations too heres my take on the whole situation epic store exclusives the means to acquire those exclusives are scummy borderline shady to say the least i dont have a problem with epics exclusives in general nor do i condone them if you want to put your product only on the epic store thats just business and i get that my problem is with epic exclusives originally slated to launch on steam if you make any kind of promise to put your game on steam whether in a trailer crowdfunding incentive or on the storefront itself available for prepurchase you are expected by the gaming community to honor and fulfill that promise if you try to shift away from steam after making said promise that is a guaranteed pr disaster epic storelauncher as a whole we can all agree that it came out of the oven way too early what we have right now is a halfbaked platform with many security and trust issues due to all the breaches and controversies surrounding it and some of the most basic luckily i dont suffer from fomo so i can wait out timed exclusives which is good anyhow since most games are released unfinished by the time the exclusive is over the game i want may be finishedthough unlikely these days i kinda wish these launchers only required me to start them when i have to installupgrade my games it shows utter contempt for the customers what would it have taken to launch their store with even basic features i wont be supporting any platform that puts the paying customer last oh ubisoft comparing store exclusives to consoles exclusives is definitely a stretch one is free the other is 400 bucks ubisoft is playing 4d chess they push more preorders by staying on steam they take epics money for exclusivity and they push the anti epic people in future to uplay letting them keep all the money win win win for them anti consumer for everyone else so i have to preorder to get it on steam this is bullshit ill pass then working on it get to 100k hmmm exclusive what site you buy from compared to console exclusive seems a bit far fetched one is a launcher that cost 0 or a console that cost 400 the real issue is as a pc gamer you have no games if your entire library is on steam give it a few months before ea signs to epic store exclusive but in saying that main reason im not going near the epic store is simply im tired of all the launchers i have to install just to play a game im not concerned overly about some spyware honestly if they want to spy on me go ahead they will see the most boring idiot on the planetbut im just not installing anymore launchers simple as pca also offer pirated softwaregames easy to infecthack ect granted consoles arent perfect and i wish we had more options but to paint pcs like they are gods gift to man is pushing it a bit now with that said i dont think pc users should have to suffer the same basic flaws that come with consoles in terms of where they get their legitimate games from im now adding a comment for this video literally the only good thing epic is doing is giving devs a better deal however that single right does not make for the metric ton of wrongs theyre trying to get away with i do hope these shenanigans come to bite them in the ass down the line because they absolutely deserve that burn for doing this to the pc market look up dick mastersons newproject2 the share difference doesnt matter to me they all sell their games for the same price in and even though the values differ vastly they already shit on us customers debunked their data mining did they not admit it was happening because of left over files the only reason they did that was because they were caught to me exclusives in themselves arent the problem however how epic is doing exclusives i do have an issue if you do exclusives make sure you make the exclusives yourself dont rip existing games or ips from other platforms that is how you piss people offif you lack the talent talent to convince others to your platform with your own effort you should not be making a platform period easily upgraded hardware constantly having to repair you grass hut and here is my comment for the video p i will never download an epic launcher i will be playing borderlands 3 though because i am going to pirate it f them and i pirated metro f epic fucking epic anno and satisfactory was something would have bought but now i wont buy them ever even if they come on steam anymore see i disagree with you this is the only way that steam can have a true companionship is for epic to do what it is doing it is not enough to have a better system if that was the case then gog would be king of the internet but to start making the games only available on epic lets not forget thats is what steam did in t the first place to get so big do i wish steam is not so much of a dumpster fire yes do i want to load a lot of launchers no i hate that i need like 5 launchers on my computer and i fought not to have epic on my computer but lets face it if steam is to ever change they need to be scared enough to change so this is how liberty dieswith thunderous applause the most ironic part of it all is that ubi launcher epic launcher anyhow theres only one way epic can make me move by buying out steam even if they somehow manage to make steam fall ignoring the consequences for digital distribution worldwide ill still pick gog over it as my main platform if that falls ill pick itch hell ill pick uplay well i might pick epic over origin or bethesda but theres still quite a lot more to come why principle before i didnt see reason to switch to it best i could do is accept it now its way below that i reject it i buy most of my pc games on gog the idea of being forced to use a launcher for a game disgusts me and while they do have their own launcher available they dont try to shove it down your throat you can either use it or choose not to i do have a few games on steam and begrudgingly use it but no chance in any version of hell will i use epic steam has been radio silent through all this and they need to step up soon it would be nice to go back to the 80s when i started pc gaming and just go to a physical store to buy my games sadly those days are long gone on a side note i just subscribed and good luck with hitting your goal great content it seems like steam is being exploited by these publishers who use the platform for the product awareness and preorders and then pocket the exclusivity money i wonder if steam could put a stop to this by contractually obligating publishers to release the game on steam at the same time as its released on any other platform for them to be able to set up a steam store page of their game oh ubisoft if the game i want to create ever becomes real ill make it a point to say its staying off the epic store for a year if only out of spite also i liked this video so im in the running for getting that nvidia rtx 2070 graphics card shame whats that im just a trollfacing wario when youtube finally gets some competition after all the bullshit its slung watch people come and say buh mayoutube most creators would be in that group also imagine an exclusive angry review from angry joe on another video platform you guys would riot exclusivity works on consoles and its gonna work better here since they know we dont need another pc to play a game on a different launcher like a console exclusive imo pc launcher exclusive just means sign in again the features of said launcher is another thing though im not saying exclusive games are cool but i mean cmon people have passed up on the latest assassins creed even though it was awesome just because they didnt want to open the ubisoft launcher lol so now they are gonna force you to do it i dont like exclusivity but money talks to these companies you might not buy any of their games and rave to the world about it but many more silent gamers exist than vocal gamers these games will still be bough im not weighing in on if anno 1800 should or shouldnt have continued on steam that said if you ask me how theyre going about it does seems to be pretty fair giving fair warning and seeking to limit damage to those who do get it through steam it feels more like ubisoft kind of pushed for this to be done so they could force extra preorders getting a mass lump of sales out of steam while also pocketing the exclusive money from the epic deal they have in place its just bad all around for consumers especially since epic claims they will stop doing the exclusive thing at some point but i imagine they kind of want to make deals with enough large studios that they can just expect the games in their storefront to bring customers i know its just a launcher but to me its an unneeded launcher with questionable practices that i just dont want i grew up during console wars with nintendo and sega its just odd to see it happening now to this level when consoles are now trying to have cross platform availability for their games especially since the live service model is so popular i can only imagine aggressive tactics like this just becoming a road map for others to do them not gonna lie i tp a certain degree assumed the halting active support of patreon did have a least a small part to do with personal political beliefs i deeply regret that and apologize god i wish more people myself included could separate bias from facts and reason as well as you can as for console exclusives well im a console peasant and i do think there is one notable pro for exclusives a pro that in no way overrules the anticonsumerness of it because exclusives are meant to sell consoles they are focused on quality above all else instead of profit above all else jim sterling has talked about this in depth epic exclusives however have no redeeming qualities they dont have the one good aspect of console exclusives because epic is simply buying exclusivity to force people to use a shit platform as opposed to how sony and nintendo actually fund and heavily contribute to the budget and quality of their exclusives microsoft clearly doesnt though just ask platinum g this is classic chinese tactics for domination of a market and that is their goal to be the dominate player in every market segment in the world by 2050 they are willing to use whatever tactics they need including paid exclusives undercutting competition in the west etc i do not want the future platform for pc game purchases to be decided by the publishers and their exclusives that is what epic stated it would be so buying a game from the epic store would go against my principles ea as started my blacklist with dragon age 2 therefor i never bought or played me3 and the epic store have joined them and i am definitely not going to pay full price for a game 6 or 12 months down after release when publishers have sold most they can on the epic store that would make me feel like a sap that means i will not buy any game that goes epic store exclusive until it is available on another store at a significant discount no mater how interesting it look and even then by that time something else more interesting might have come strait to gog or steam as consumers the only real power we have is to not spend our money when it comes to epic and steam i feel some confuse two different types of competition its true that competition is good for us as customers but thats not the competition we are seeing here we are seeing the company vs company competition instead of competing over customers this is used as a defense when its somewhat irrelevant to us that all these companies are in competition with each other and the competition we want is the one they have taken of the table with exclusivity unfortunately i expect epic to get away with it based on preorder sales numbers i dont expect people as a whole to show restraint even if its for the good of all of us orcs must die unchained got shut down just subbed here found you on exclusively games and so far im loving your channel and your vids keep up the great work like a lot of others myself and my household are actively boycotting not only epic store but the devs who are going exclusive with them i disagree that the extra money theyre getting from epic is going to go to better games weve already seen that sheer greed is all publishers and many devs have going for them theyll pocket the extra and continue to give us halffinished buggy games until gamers hopefully stop buying them until then i predict a surge in board gaming popularity but can you really equate console exclusives to pc store exclusives the former require that you literally throw money at new boxes all the time while the latter only requires you to download a free launcher i dont like the epic store myself but i think that the exclusivity argument is a bit exaggerated at the moment interesting thought about bringing all ubisoft games to the epic store to this im inclined to agree reason being is that id wager more people are buying from uplay and not the epic store by going this method so by using the epic store as a scapegoat for leaving steam they just get more sales with their own service with little to no backlash on themselves so will you be adding epic to the dirty dev list wow they really missed a huge opportunity there on the naming not going with covfefe i like pc but the only games i ever will play on pc is mmo rpgs like wow or stor the other games i play on console less modder cheaters i have made this comment before and ill make it here review bombing doesnt really work that well file antitrust complaints with the ftc epic is interfering with a competitor using anticompetitive actions that in any physical store would be illegal what i mean specifically is products that were already in contract to be sold by steam andor actively being sold are forced away due to these deals the ones not being sold yet are a grey area but might also be questionable the more complaints they receive the more likely it is that they will investigate console exclusives are a different matter and there is a reason they have been ignored or just allowed but i wont go into that here i hate government involvement but if you dont have any other choice you need to do this laws in the digital realm are slow to adapt microsoft got away with obvious antitrust violations for years epic is skirting the edges here which is why i believe they dropped the length to 6 months lengt patreon literally banned chinese woman whos on short foot with tech its a bit shit site which spends most of its assets to kill off competition with u r nazi platform card it can ultimately be up to developers or publishers where they want something distributed but if it was meant to be somewhere and then pulled because some unpopular store waved some cash in their face das no good now i will get to the topic outside of my last post the whole idea of online store exclusives i will say that i have steam and ubisoft all because you need uplay for their games the exclusive market being on consoles well it is all about helping one console over another people whine and say i want this on this console or want this on pc well guess what publishers only look at the numbers and see things differently after all there are some console exclusives that came to pc and people bombed it all because the consoles are shit or something about graphical settings and all that yet they begged for it on pc as i see it those who whine the loudest will always whine i do hate epic i hate them and hate how they are trying to undermine everything even hate the publishers that are so blind to the fact if they just look at the numbers and realize if they just opened up on all markets then they would get a lot of profit as someone that uses the epic game store will steam should do something about all these fuckers that use steam for a massive almost free marketing and then removing it for another trash store steam will just sit back and enjoy the dumpster fire epic will eventually run out of fortnite money when the fad dies and be left effectively bankrupt unless tencent or a publisher coalition decides to buy them but i doubt anyone will be that stupid enough to fund that sinking ship the windows live store already attempted this crap years ago and it failed miserably if microsoft cant enslave pc gamers then what chance does epic have i may have clicked and dragged my mouse multiple times across the video to try and play the game im just so used to doing that for all the rts games i play here on pc it is coffee like the drink the drink after all it their tab button reads buy me a cup of coffee it is no cofi anyone who says that is wrong it is coffee there should be a law about pc exclusive that it should be illegal its always so funny to hear tim sweeney say that this is going to be good for the pc market but forgets he himself was losing his mind in 2017 over microsofts attempts to do the same with uwp and in some cases actually using several of the same complaints we have for the epic store today the lack of self awareness from this man and from epic is ludicrous this hurts me deeply there is no whatever when it comes to coffee coffee is life you should think about your slight against humanity whilst youre in your baconless selfimposed exile shameful exclusive console games while being absolutely anticonsumer have become sort of a necessary evil take bloodborne and dad of boy for example both games are focused single player content thats above pretty much anything on the industry and both have discarded all the scummy monetization practices to focus solely on the quality of the product sadly you rarely see that from big publishers anymore when theres no ulterior motive for them in this case that motive is of course selling the excluding console that focuses the publisher to show their best side and frankly ill rather take that than constant pestering to pay me for content that was cut just to sell it back to me in pieces also those deals have usually been made way before the public even knows about the game or the platform holder straight up owns the developing company so there was never a chance or choice that the game would seen on any other platform epic exclusives on the other hand have so far been retroactive crypto solves all payment issues yeah another game to buy on torrent ill confess i mostly dont want to install yet more launchers or digital store fronts same with all those streaming services companies keep opening congrats sid epic is doing a fantastic job of making me far less interested in games i might have otherwise purchased closer to release i have no problem ditching steam they have to worst customer support ever sells me a game and 3 hours into a 6 hour game the game is broken and steam wont give a refund i have saved 400 due to most games going to epic games storei refuse to download that feature lacking excuse of a launcher and i will wait untill 2020 fuck em blame valve this isnt dirty valve got complacent frankly steam has had a run the market i wont call it a monopoly but they are the other big player i dont mind companies choosing the use epic store exclusively though id prefer they didnt i do have a problem with paid exclusives great vid sid b if steam ends up shutting down because of all the exclusives i will stop playing games on pc so you choosing not to support patreon is good but a developer choosing not to support steam is bad department stores have exclusive clothing lines from famous designers every restaurant has an exclusive deal with either coke or pepsi netflix has exclusive deals with tons of content providers even iphone started exclusive to specific carriers exclusives are everywhere why am i supposed to get so horribly offended about pc games doing this the cokepepsi thing annoys me far more than having to buy a pc game from a different storefront because i literally get sick from one brands cola so i have to check before ordering every time so im curious about who patreon removed and why was violence or hate being advocated or just innocent speach free speech after all is not speach without consequences genuinely curious and of course asking for comment and channel engagement keep up the good work as always sidalpha what person did they ban this is a comment so this video gets more attention i wish i could sympathize with pc gamers but i cant i dont see any other means of ending the steamopoly to state the this has been debunked thing you do know that epics ceo admitted it was doing that stuff right how is it debunked if literally the ceo said yeah thats been happening were sorry you should use float plane from linus tech tips they are a sub where you can use as sub only you can upload vids or livestream there not completely live but there working with some big channels including live streaming live us tech tips content exlusives meaning is warped people think of it as console exclusive while its not up to this point steam was pretty much in a situation of total monopoly if you check out the of sales its actually pretty scary i like epic stepping up their market store doesnt look like a teenagers dumpster room despite missing features just do what i did with the division 2 buy it on uplay store and add it to steam all ubisoft games require uplay on steam already it would have been better for epic to just undercut valves distribution share however races to the bottom tend to put the squeeze on those racing so anybodys guess on how that would turn out as someone whos played a lot of anno the background video hurt to watch p valve needs to update their terms for developers that prevents them from removing games or delaying them for steam once its listed for steam ubisoft are a conjob company that repeatedly releases poorly made games for over priced sums glad you found a place that makes a good kofi i think this is just a continued problem of the game companies selling a service not a physical product that is the treason that is tracking the power away from the consumers at the core i dont mind it as much on console but it is really stupid on pc dont get me wrong i am not defending consoles as it sucks as i have a few games that i want but i can get cuz i dont own the console also i am a pc gamer to xd is sidalpha a furry i mean with ubisoft games it doesnt really matter all ubisoft games road up to the shitty uplay i had the anno 1800 and anno 2250 on my steam wishlist needless to say when i saw the email for anno 1800 and the game has a 60 and a 80 option i decided to remove them i wont be picking up anno anytime soon i wish gog let you purchase credits on cards the same way steam does id be buying so many more games i just dont trust any of the storefronts with my credit card numbers call me paranoid but even big stores like target have been hacked id rather have that digital air gap to protect myself why people keep sayng that epic vs steam is a console war there you needed another hardware to play the games exclusive to other platform on pc you just need another launcher next getting times exclusives was to way for epic to bring buyers to their store look what happends with gog and steam most people will buy a game on steam even that is on gog too same thing will happend with epic because is a buyng custom so lets give epic time if you dont like it dont buy games from them kofire or kofi whatever sidalpha you remember the black kid from the jetsons no aint the future wonderful i for one have preordered the deluxe edition from steam way back in january cant wait until the 16th for every epic game store exclusive theres an outward or risk of rain 2 i am honestly surprised that you dont have a sound board of yourself sid just take your frequently used statements assign an arbitrary number to it and record the most quality version of it for repeated use probably save you a lot of time and can use that extra time for something else like finding out how youre gonna make bigfry eat your dust in subs or figure out how to say that donation thingie what epic is doing makes sense from a business point of view from a public relations point of view its a mistake them snooping around paired with the exclusives makes them the bad guys ill never support exclusives on pc i have self control and many choices so i can easily skip borderlands read dead redemption or whatever game epic gets an elusive on i have no love for steam but im not gonna allow epic to force me on to their crappy platform i vote with my wallet and i vote against the bad guy they rely on games being dumb and having to self control that is why we have so many microtransactions game as a service and now an attempt on exclusives i hope we prove them wrong at least this time id say that steam didnt force any exclusives to their store because they never had to they were the goto digital storefront for games for a very long time now epic introduced exclusives this is not a good thing for the users since it limits user choice but at this point epic can only compete with such a dominant platform like steam by making games exclusive to their store at least i couldnt think of any other strategy better revenue share for devs users couldnt care less better curated store minor annoyance but not the strongest argument for choosing another store at least from a consumer standpoint bringing features up to par with steams why even bother choosing another store then the only reason why ubisoft ditched steam is because each time they did and went to epic their sales on their own store tripledso they are using epic to basicly make more money on their own platform lol steamkeys as a preorder bonus what a time to be alive sid saying console exclusives are anti consumer because it limited consumer choice is in many cases just not true those games exist because the console company itself made the game or paid for it being made without that reason to make the game to further their console sales the game would not even exist the game not existing gives far less choice to people than it being an exclusive one which may move to more systems some years later too i also would like to point out the barrier to entry is a lot lower on pc digital stores we have proved epic isnt stealing our data to give to china yes so the objection to using the epic store now besides to protest the exclusive deals is what that the store is crap by comparison is that a big deal when it comes down to games most of the time steams various features you click the game and it runs right do you need much more am i the only one who remembers when all pc games had their own stand alone install uninstall p steam isnt even fighting back though you cant have healthy competition if you ignore youre opponent maybe steam has plans at e3 but its like they want to lose on purpose well i havent bought a ubisoft game in a long time especially since they went to their own launcher so its fine if they move away from steam you can still buy anno from uplay better than giving epic money i guess shame i was looking forward to this game and im not about to preorder ubisoft hats pc gamars until i bought a ps4 this christmas the last console i bought was a wii 10yrs ago the reason i bought a ps4 spiderman detroit becomes human red dead redemption 2 all ps4 exclusives that both me and my kids wanted to play still not sure about what epic is doing but as my youngest plays sims4 were already playing on a nonsteam launcher epic will just be added to the list of annoyance ubisoft made a joke on eas greed with assassins creed odyssey yet they are doing the same shit that ea is doing here is the silliest of comments another game of my list food for the algomob i think this is first time i have seen a video about a game i really care about i suspected this would happen so i bought it on steam i know you should not preorder games but this time i could not not do it customers opinion its corporations were talking about not a small business capitalism at its finest 50 denuvo ubisoft launcher required not a single fuck was given i would not call the spyware issue cleared up sure they might not have sent any data theyre not supposed to but the program is still collecting and its still snooping into steam files and associated information it has not business with im supposed to just take their word for it and hope they dont change their mind one day epic has not by any means earned that good faith when a physical copy is cheaper and your money goes to the local store deepsilver and 2k can eat a dick for their disgusting digital regional pricing practices i havent bought anything from the store mostly due to not having local currency and transaction fees this quote from yongyeas video sums this all up for me there is nothing wrong with the spirit of competition but theres a distinction to be made between competing by giving versus by competing by taking away steam was like a lazy bum for too long and its their share of fault but i wont buy from epic store anything at least until they have a freaking shopping cart i hope you reach 100k subs soon cant wait to hear you sing d i thought valve were still looking into the spyware claims at least in regards to why the epic store copies data sure epic themselves issued a statement but theyre not going to admit to doing anything shady unless they have tothey just claimed bad programming honestly im fine with sitting back and waiting to see what exactly happens in regards to the epic store since i dont touch anything like that whilst its still in its infancy im not going to be an unpaid beta tester and id rather not invest money into a system might not have staying power i object to the fact that many of epics timed exclusives were previously advertised on steam and some were even on gog since its a bit crappy to get to the point the point of offering preorders on steam and then pull the game from stores or promise the people who funded you game that itll be on their platform of choice and then go back on it sure all you have to do is make an account for the epic but at the same time it sid stop already you only have one platform on pc that is the pc it doesnt matter which damned program or application you decide to use to play a game the platform is pc why the fuck are people bitching about any of this for fuck me sid and all others grow the fuck up do you use windows or linux do you use google or bing do you whatever whatever it doesnt bloody matter it is all on pc it is the same damned platform just different software now no offence but all the fucking whinging and whining like little children who have been told no you cant have a mars bar you must have a snickers fuck me find something else already epic this epic that most of the idiots complaining have never known anything but steam since it always there kind of like trees and roads and the ground we walk on maybe they think god said and lo let there be steam and there was oh and your comment on steam being steam and them not paying people to use their software no you are right that while i do wish for your success and wellbeing on youtube these long prefaces in your videos lately are really annoying you talk about stuff unrelated to the video for a solid 2 and a half minutes thats almost a fourth of this video heres the thing valve has yet to fight back on this war of storefronts theyve done nothing but tell people this game will no longer be available on steam not by our own choice but by epic buying them out this fuels contempt for epic and their storefront which offers no benefits to consumers has some shady happenings going on and is a weaker service overall their only claim of superiority is that they pay a bigger revenue to developers and seem to be putting a few greenbacks straight in the pockets of heavy hitters so what happens when valve decides to lower their sales cut for developers all they have to do is go right games on steam will only cost you the devs 10 and the dumpster fire that is the epic store will go up in flames exactly because they have nothing else to offer and that fortnite money wont last forever and then we are back at square one valve continues to be shit with steam as they continue to remove games due to a political bia i give the egs about 1 2 years until they increase the revenue split and stop or at least drastically reduce the exclusivity payments right now the egs is losing them money considering the huge amounts of money they must spend on those exclusivity deals probably a lot and even with epics and tencents immense budget at some point even they wont invest in an endeavour that is activly losing them money this whole shitshow is just their agressive attempt at forcing as many consumers as possible to their platform which as said in the video is offering the consumer sweet fa instead of using their funds to actually give consumers a reason to choose their platform like gog with its drm free titles does they simply force consumers to their store which i dont see would motivate them in the future to actually improve their product so for anyone who doesnt want to support their shitty scheme and who rightfully so doesnt want to pirate games those people would have to s as i wrote on another video this was the reason steam was good for devs they tried to ease piracy with cheaper games and sales so it was not worth pirating now we are getting exclusives people will pirate again and it will be interesting to see when games do come to steam how much they want for a 612 month old game if they try to sell it for full price or 10 cheaper because all the people who said i will wait for it to come to steam they are going to try to screw them over this is where we can teach them a lesson and not buy the game until it drops dramatically in price so they will need a bigger payout from epic to do it again you have already waited for the game on their terms so they can wait for your money on your terms how much does the pirate lifestyle cost you an arm and a leg dont care you need to launch uplay to play ubisoft games anyway just buy it on uplay ffs xd whos a good algorithm yes you are yes you are want a treat as a massive anno fan who owns every entry and who signed up for and played the 1800 beta id rather not play the game than buy from epic or uplay i didnt buy a single ubisoft game for more than 2 years when they imposed their always online bs on us and i didnt miss them in the slightest and was never lost for something exciting to play its a no sale from this long time anno fan screw you epic and screw you ubisoft question why was it okay for steam to have exclusive games to it but not epic well ubisoft been on steam always felt odd as for steam its a launcher for a launcher but to me this means that for the most part if true i wont be playing any ubisoft games going forward epic lost morality what is called the west has lost its morality long ago do what you want coz a pirate is free not gonna support epic i prefer go back to piracy steam is my favorite only because of valve proton and pro consumer practices tencent store can go to hell and when proton implements game i am interested in windows can go to hell too companies love collecting your data without your consent and censorship oh boy there is nothing that makes me more furious than censorship liking your animationtransitions slick i dont like exclusives but i certainly understand why epic has to do these things in order to compete therefore i cant really blame them i do think their launcherstore is horrible though but thats a different story itll get better eventually i think its called cofeefee im sure this was a coincidence as i commented on another of your videos yesterday asking you to give your thoughts on this exact topic but nonetheless i am glad to see a video from you on this topic while i much less care about games being launcher exclusive or having multiple launchers installed my big issue with epic was the concern over the privacy policies that i had read about so your inclusion to the line of sight video was much appreciated personally i am not going to buy any of the epic exclusives i rather pirate the games then give epic so much as a dim i might have if they had not pushed the damn paid exclusives to the point where just about ever new game is an epic online and games that had been annoncerede as being on coming to steam suddenly getting flipped to epic only wish is damn fun since epic them self have been out saying they wouldnt do that any more and less then a week after that statment not one but three major titles have been announced as epic only i gave up the fact that i want to install one gaming library on my pc as a result of that fact i dont really care that i have to install epics store just to get the game i want the barrier of entry is low unlike the console war where i have to buy a 300 to 600 brick to play the games i want is it lame that epic is doing predatory practice yes but does it really bother me no its on the same hardware with ubisoft ill just buy directly from them its other games that you can only get on epic i have an issue with that they paid to have only on there page i refuse to back epic cause of how its buying its way instead of earning through good practice and there goes my hope for the comming settlers fucking epic what they got from the exclusive the game still on steam till release they only got backlash o epic store for me isnt even close to being a viable choice theyll charge me 9 in currency conversion steam was already guilty of this one too on top of that theyll charge 8 extra in payment processing fees the final price im paying for a 60 dollar game is 7182 usd thats more than 10 of my monthly income i stopped caring about the cut the developer gets im paying the difference directly the real cut egs gets is 20 to 29 the 12 developers publishers pay is just deception to hide that consumers are the ones paying the rest of the 30 cut they are used to so because patreon banned sargon of akkad you wont support it nor advertise it anymore funny cause as i look into the video description i clearly see a list of 19 biggest patreon supporters advertised in the video you tell people to stay on patreon despite your claims you do in fact advertise it and support it why dont you actually boycott it for what they did the money is too good what patreon did to sargon doesnt actually matter to you im almost glad that i seem to be losing interest in modern games saves me quite a bit of drama it would almost be worth my entire steam library just to hear the whining of those who believe this to be no big deal if this were to ultimately result in steam being unable to maintain market share and go under causing all these people to realize what digital distribution actually means when they lose access to all their steam games gog gets priority entirely on the basis of their drmfree service alone steam for everything else ive never installed origin and ea has not yet convinced me that this was a bad idea and epic can shove it i refuse to give them any business and i refuse to purchase products that have accepted these trade deals i dont trust sweeny or anyone who gets into bed with him and his words and actions have done nothing to convince me otherwise if ea and activision have taught us anything its that publicly traded companies worry more about their investors and filching people out of their money than they do the customer and making good produ i cant say i buy into epics words things getting better for the players because of the higher revenue split i cant see publishers passing on those savings or loosening up on whatever schemes they come up with to get more money out of folks i mean we might see benefits with some games indies come to mind but as a whole i dont see much of a change coming more likely that they will just pocket the savings and at most maybe toss a few shekels and crumbs our way epics reasoning of it being good for developers might be true but when has anything that has been good for developers been good for the customers just like how tax cuts are good for businesses and then that would be passed on to the people when in reality its only the bosses that get bigger pays and bonuses same goes for the gaming industry only the investors and ceos will ever benefit from things like epic im not big into the anno series the supply chains were something i never really got into and the poor combat options liked the city building though along with the quests a ways back i spent a good amount of time playing 1404 and 2070 1800 i wont be picking up not only because ubisoft decided to take away customer choice but also because they put devuno drm in it on steam they have to disclose this fact but i dont see it anywhere on the epic store page doesnt matter where a ubisoft game releases as long as they implement garbage denuvo in all their games they are only worth pirating hell tropico 6 is already available on pirate sites and its been out only a week or so shows how useless that drm is with all respect if you meant the spyware claims against epic games launcher were debunked valve said they were aware it had happened and epicgames themselves even issued a public statement confirming it on the note of consoles last one was a ps2 too consoles just got too costly i got into pc gaming and pc upgrades cost less and went a lot further than constantly replacing consoles all this is doing is making me consider pirating games rather than buying them not that im pro steam or pro piracy i just am pro consumer choice i want to be able to choose what platform i get my games on and so far epic is not that platform and probably will not be for a year or even more keep up the good work sid just download and crack had a atari 800 because pc wasnt a option and a playstation orginal console for blood omen otherwise i have been and will always be a pc gamer and i fucking hate epic for bringing the crap from the consoles to pc and the shitheads that support it i wish companies would stop doing things that are political when they are a platform that provides a service that everyone uses im actually really annoyed that patreon is doing this political shit to its customers when its supposed to be a damn service that should be unbiased i didnt put up with this shit with firewatch and im not putting up with it from patreon i think your actions are completely justified here when a company pulls that shit well i guess thats another game that will get a year of bugfixes and updates before i buy it then steam needs to make it part of its distributorpublisher terms of service that as a condition of advertising on their store front that the product must be available no later than the same day as any other distribution system at the moment publishers are using steam to advertise their games and then after the game has achieved some recognition then pulling it from the store i would even go so far as to offering a loyalty discount to publishers who exclusively distribute digitally through the steam launcher as to those claiming steam is greedy 30 is what brick and mortar stores take on the sales of games too you been traveling down this road too long the solution as i see it have more people and companies make more games so the chances that you get something similar on 2 different platforms increases how shrug i really dont know it probably requires at least looking at the problem from a legal standpoint and assessing the regulations you have to see what is causing issues which includes both regulations causing problems and lack of regulations causing problems and most likely requires looking at the problem from a distribution of wealth perspective at which point youre talking about fixing a problem inherent to gaming by taking a good hard look at how your economy is set up either way the solution is simple increase competition in the games market and the problem of paid exclusives diminishes it feels like the games market is devolving into a aaa oligopoly with an underfunded underground scene which is allowing for predatory and immoral practices to take place for the games with talent behind them with a seco to be honest patreon was probably forced by paypall andor visa andor mastercard which are the actual censors in this situation they have a track record of using their oligopoly on payment processing to censor things they dont like if patreon didnt do anything they might have pulled support so i dont know how much of it was their decision in the first place since youve been discussing about distribution exclusivity sid i suggest you should take a look at the matter of platform advertising specifically console pc which triggers a lot of people lately yes we hate store exclusivity but i cant help questioning when seeing trailers just slapping ps4 xbox one steam at the outro shouldnt it be pc its like the game developers themselves are baiting people into thinking theyll get the game on said store day1 while in reality the game itself is a pc version it should be advertised as coming to ps4xbox onepc and nobody would complain epic buying out games isnt healthy sure but are the game devs to blame too for over favoring a store that they promised something which they could easily back out for either by higher uppublisher decision or the money being too good to turn down epic also has security issues and ive read several instances where people have lost their accounts to brute force attacks im not about to put my money somewhere without 2fa at the very least battlenet uplay and steam have all done it origin i think has done it too epic has not and seemingly will not for a while longer still fuck epic back to being a pirate my mateys arrrrrrrrrrrr maybe its pronounced covfefe this isnt surprising in my perspective im not sure if the anno series is cursed with troubled releases or because ubisoft loves to create problems with their executive meddling it might also have something to do with both epic and ubisofts biggest shareholder is tencent holdings ltd trying to create some vertical integration with all their gaming companies which is just a very thin guise to assimilate those companies among others they have sizeable shares into wegame the chinese analog of steam and another arm of the chinese governments domesticsurveillance infrastructure god so help me if they demand i need an epic account to play it honestly when you look at the numbers i think epic is doing the only things that will allow them to genuinely compete with valve as a marketplace without seriously bold moves theres no way they could knock a big enough chunk out of the marketshare steam holds to not just become another token alsoran like gog etc as digital sales rise and physical sales fade we need some real competition to keep the market open yes i used the word market a lot but with different definitions i dont think epic plan to keep this level of exclusives going long term and im hoping itll be more of a foot in the door strategy when people say they should compete by offering a better service i respond they are at least they are offering a chance of better service over the long haul and i dont see how else they will get there as for all the features steam has epic doesnt i really dont care i hardly touch any of that anyway so i sure wont miss it there are better p sid i left using console specificlly because of exclusives i didnt like to have titles i liked going from on to another year by year sometimes leaving me high and dry unless i were to buy another system pc i could pick one or two storefronts and be set now though one storefront i hate due to lack of quality is starting the war on pc and paying to make sure my favoured storefronts dont get games i am interested in luckily microsoft store will have outer worlds the rest i will wait for i guess oh well straps on his eyepatch well thats a shame i like anno some of the points in that line of sight video where wrong about spying just saying yes the tcp connection and internal communication between services like epic is using is correct but cookies and several other points where completely wrong when it comes to spying epic admited to actually spy on peoples pcs in a way its weird steam was one of the first distributors to lock games to their platform and now everyones upset epic has turned it back around on them if epic wants to keep tossing their fornite money directly at devs making great games thats a good thing does epic really force competition thats like saying that windows phone was realistic competition with the iphone exclusives are aok if they were made by the storefirst game or contract work to make a game for them i find that to be acceptable as said product might not exist without the deal in place paid exclusives to keep things off store front nah mate i find that to be pretty shitty they are paying to keep games off competitors shelves that would have been there had it not been for the extra money dropping of course it would more effort to make an exclusive first party game but that would give better consumer trust to boldly slay where no one has slain before al gore rhythm slayer iotishw idiot of the information superhighway as an annoholic the background footage really hurts i freaking love that quote amazing vid as always hope kofi isnt as restrictive as patreon was no sidalpha the increased revenue is a terrible idea you dont give a homeless man addicted to crack more money aaagaming has long since earned this comparison it will not go to benefit anyone other than the people on top i cant believe this is happening steam you are not invincible give these greedy fucks that extra 15 people go to where the games are thats why the ps4 is way better than the xbone people like me who actually have a conscience will stick with steam sure but the majority of people are on the fence about this kind of thing when it comes to boycotting games they only talk big but they are so easily manipulated by shiny things that theyll sell their soul for a paperclip and epic is getting a shit load of exclusives it is fucking despicable and i would gladly destroy that company for destroying pc gaming but how long are we supposed to boycott half of all the best games out there for pc huh how long are we supposed to hold out how long can we epic is just nabbing the best games out there while your store fills up with the shittiest shit that has ever been called a video game match epics offers or better and make sure you get ever single game that the real gamers rea i support your choice to leave patreon i have seen many people banned without any violations simply on ideological grounds while i do not agree with many of these people politically i will never agree with banning simply because one does not agree with them if we stifle discourse and debate socratic we limit societal growth i have seen several people such as dave rubin and tim pool who i might not agree with but o definitely respect move off platform voluntarily rather than wait for them to get banned i wish valve would do something to combat this shit im getting sick of them just sitting there maybe they could release a game you knowmaybe something with a 3 in it im happy for anything to break steams stranglehold if it means a year of exclusives so be it i doubt epic will keep that up it cant be great for their bottom line they are paying out a lot of money in the end theyll get their userbase and things will simmer down if it doesnt then ill gripe about it but i had epic installed before i ever installed steam the first time never wanted steam in the first place but it was the only way to play certain games now almost all of my games are on steam thousands of dollars worth of games too many eggs in one basket exclusivity is a lazy way of strong arming us into using their platform instead of actually improving their client and giving us better deals egs will just keep grabbing games and eventually may even change it from timed exclusive to permanent exclusivity people who excuse and allow this exclusivity need to remember that this is the game industry you give these companies an inch and theyre greed will find a ways to push it to extremes you have never imagined id rather support discords own gaming store than egs they give a nice revenue share slightly better than epic and they dont do this bribery exclusive bullshit im all for competition but paying money out to developers for exclusivity is dumb ill wait for these games to come out on steam or buy them on xb1 i wont do business with a company that is in essence an arm of the chinese government i might as well send a copy of my harddrive to the red chinese i know im dating myself here but i remember when people knew better than to trust the reds ill likeshare comment hell ill give you a creepy look if it helps lol i must admit that epic has quite some issues but i would blame steam for what is going on in terms if exclusivity steam does not adapt to the market and remains its 30 fee for sales one big argument for having the epic store is the competition towards the monopoly of steam and steam just decided to not take action epic is regulating the market while steam plays the victim here i dont like the epic store but i can not fault them for trying to be attractive towards developers steam is the one who passively lets the developers go towards epic im eager to read some other thoughts on this topic to all those saying they will never buy a game that used to be an epic exclusive im suggesting another way of thinking if you wait until it comes out on steam and then buy it obviously if you still want it then you are sending a clear message about your preferences to the publisher i dont think just not buying it will have that much of an impact whereas pointing out that if they hadnt gone exclusive they would have had many more sales up front will i remember buying half life 2 getting home and being forced to install steam i was absolutely disgusted and couldnt fathom why i had to install thisthingin order to play a pc game i wasnt alone there was a ton of outrage over needing steam in order to play half life 2 at the time it wasnt a distribution platform it just seemed like this arbitrary launcher for a highly anticipated game now i cant imagine pc gaming without steam im hoping that in ten years time this platform exclusivity bullshit wont seem normal like steam does now all right ill keep doing what i usually do ie write a pointless comment i also got said email from steam the game looks interesting but not enough to make me prepurchase it on steam and im not very thrilled about buying it on the epic store well see now i may not buy it at all copy paste this so the youtube algorithm sees this comment gonna have to wait thats all make me ashamed of gaming on consoles why dont you i play on pc too but before say pc is superior to consoles dont its been a fun ride dude but this is goodbye edit im sorry for acting like petty idiot last night you are quite right big companies do look for ways to improve profits i think in the case of ubisoft they saw how disliked the egs is and it is because of that reason that they decided to put their games there the end goal to drive more customers to their own uplay store where they will get the best cut of all even better than when they sell on the egs as they get to keep all the revenue add to that the better cut from the egs and i can see why a numbers pusher would make that decision even probably calculating how much customers they would lose in the short term and how many they would retain or gain in the long term however it would have been nice to see ubisoft go a completely different route to put their games on all stores i certainly would like to see a high profile game come out on all platforms including gog or even discord to see which one does best i think that would also keep the complaints low or nonexsistant alas no one wants to do that or rather ta if they want to be the necessary evil they should at least know what comes with painting your self the villain trying to do good there is no happy end for them on that rout forever blacked by the misdeeds holy shit that sounds odd at the end but its true its piracy then 915 did you remember where the quote is from i was actually excited when the epic game store was announced now im gonna do a hard skip on games that did and will do timedexclusivity deals with epic i may miss out on some games satisfactory comes to mind but its not that big of a loss people think a publisher getting a slightly higher percentage somehow sees developers earn more and make better games or see a price cut for consumers hasnt happened yet in fact overseas like here in aus epic charges more so the only thing steam can do to compete is buy titles from publishers to sell them which cant work because the only reason epic can do that is by using fortnite money to corner the market at a loss its not making money at that point it could take upward of 200000 sales just to start seeing a return for a game that is a paid for exclusive and we dont even know how much they paid for borderlands 3 yet my assumption is the largest sum yet epic is just ruining the market in hopes that when the chips land theyre caught holding the larger customer base and done enough damage to steam to warrant their investment meanwhile it will 100 inflate the prices across the board once this competition dies off you have my subscribers well maybe my axe would be more helpful the link to the exclusively games video you talked about didnt show up in the video can you link which video it is here please congrats on the big changes and im sure you will get the 100k soon my dude what ubisoft is doing is not dumping steam its using epic to boost its publicity as every game that goes the epic route gets lots of attention and their game requires uplay which sells their games cheaper they are exploiting epic and the uproar to get more eyes at their game which if you ask me is a genius approach and doesnt help epic its so weird to stand by valve after all the fighting with them i always wanted some competition to arise and make steam move a little but not like this sad day in gaming when the ubisoft store is the best platform a game is releasing for exclusivity has no place on pc we as gamers must yell with our wallets and tell the epic store to fuck off we can wait till it goes to steam respectfully i disagree reason being that exclusivity and exclusivity distribution are different things and epic are just using business tactics in respect of cost of entry into a market steam got complacent and thus is unable to react morality has little in respect of business especially as to reasoning behind corporate social responsibility and reasoning for the use of such algorithm food bummer the game looks like it would be awesome but i will never buy it now i dipped my coinpurse in your kofi sid how does it remove choice its still 100 available on pc no one has to pay any more the only difference is which distributor the consumer does not loose choice other than where but to be fair there wasnt much choice for plenty of games already it is important to remember whenever using steam as a comparison that epic is only doing what steam did first dirty underhanded tactics while epic has brought money into it its not a way that negatively effects the consumer im 100 against console or hardware exclusives distributor or store front exclusives are pseudo exclusives in that their still available on the platform yet another pointless comment there are certain unifying issues that almost everybody can agree upon the openness of pc as a platform is one of them threatening that is a very bad idea just ask microsoft hey sid would the paid exclusive bit explain why a dev who gave keys for beta testing on steam removed them cause they would have had to or would that be up to the devs in that situation i dont know enough about the scenario to know but i had one yanked right before they announced the year exclusive with epic drinking game take a shot every time he says kofi or coffee or whatever too late for a video tonight will watch in the morning okey then anno wont be on my to buy list right as im wondering else i can do to put off sleeping a wild sid video appears it took me 11 episodes to realize that his main island is named egg and ham do you do minecraft builds anymore q can you track a citizen like you could in skylines or have anno eliminated that option because of agent limit

like exibition fair and the tourist dock do cocaine and weed in the new world p the first 5 12 minutes of this video was some of the funniest commentary ive heard from keralis in awhile it would be

notification squad cant wait to watch this this is my drug now 3 notification squad i love the smell of you all first finally right on time first you should play this with a calculator nearby your math abilities are lacking no offense just trying to help dont buy any game from ubisoft i warned you they will cgarge your card and not give you the game if you make a support ticket it will take 39 days to get a standard reply that they will investigate the problem if you look on internet yes i was stupid enough to do it before i bought it you see the problem is there for years why do you think they cancel the steam launch because they would get tons of negative reviews i do not say the games are bad just the platform the support and everything with ubisoft in the name is just pure horror such an irresolutely gameplay omgi have a cancer nowjust put it will worker production be sped up if you locate some of your housing closer to your production facilities or is worker unhappiness increased by proximity to potential sources of pollution certainly in the 1800s before the advent of mass transportation virtually all worker housing was by necessity located adjacent to production and manufacturing facilities i like how you design the layout you are good keep t up dude watching you play this has me cringing why do youtubers upload lets plays before they even understand the basics just from this video its apparent youve never played anno please lay for like an hour before you start a new game simple its tropico just another age the potato farm gave me an aneurysm but i very much want this game editing news propaganda because people dont need to know about reality right ever applied that to real world thinking if you do it in a game what stops big media from doing the same in rl thanks so much to you and others who took the time to make these videos so helpful on a whim i bought anno 1404 a while ago and it was my first experience with an anno game couldnt believe i had never even heard of it but i was clueless as to how to play the dang thing then heard that 1800 was coming out and i am stunned by the graphics of this game would love to see a roman era rendition of anno as well to compete with the disastrous rome2 by sega thank you for another enjoyable lp i am coming from your dawn of man lp love the close ups to see what happening in the town well at least you dont have a problem with unemployment anyone who gets fired instantly has a new job can you name the pub i feel like pub g would be a super popular hangout for young men man your voice is so soothing and the background music is what made me watch the video to the end i dont even watch the tv series that are 1h long at one go sometimes but this this is special had to chuckle when im bad at math and i count faster than the video author rotate the minimap in the same time with camera rotating its weird to move left on the map but on the minimap to move right come on the only thing thats missing is a night turning off the random comments would be an important option for the devs to include i want to learn annoseries before i buy anno 1800 which one should i buy and are most similar in mechanics to anno 1800 sorry for my terrible english and hour of where shall i place this no thats not right lets make it pretty and ill get to that later even though its a quest please ow please be like anno 1404 or 2070 had to laugh at your newspaper changes how quickly you became a despot the real world at work how can i buy this game lol they stole the narrator from the guild the quest book being open the whole time is annoying af too lol hope to see more love the anno games just came across your channel this morning and sat with my morning coffee to enjoy the entire youtube view of anno it was fantastic you have a new subscriber i fully enjoy what you offer and how you explain anno this is something that i will continue to watch as this is an item i have been looking forward to obtaining thank you so much i enjoy watching how you are building the village and keeping track of the variety of changes taking place great job god its painful to watch you take minutes to place a simple lumberjack and sawmill i love anno but the fighting is the only part i dont like how does this game play on a gtx 1080 it seemed to run fairly smooth on your rig i love anno since 1602 you have found a new settlement ah i love that narration but the combat mechanics is usually too lacking for mp and i only have time for mp games these days how are the combat mechanics far too cautious with the residential if they can fix their multiplayer until release this is by far the best anno ever so much fun except the desyncs in multiplayer just watching this now dunno if you learn it in the later episodes but when upgradingbuilding houses you can hold down the button to upgradeplace several at once i regret watching this video progress like a snail not compare but please see this video httpsyoutubegbk7yvcf0zg you think way too small for anno moar is better you are not very efficient in this game honestly from what i see looks mostly like resking to anno 2070 its nice to see how long it takes for one thing to be made makes it much easier to know without googling it all for the answers i got the closed beta myself the games amazing just a bit taxing on the computer i found but hey its a beta loving this game have you a woodcutter and sawmill built 3x3 housing blocks 3x3 housing blocks blueprint mode happens because you lacked the resources to produce them immediately think of it as a queue pronounce it like the word up schnupps if you pronounce the a in schnapps englishamerican it would be schnepps or schpps uplay not with that crappy loading software you use the word like far too often and also incorrectly thats so very annoying it isnt even a particularly difficult word in the english language it looks amazing im looking forward to playing it great vid what does he have against the farmer work force some warning flags the ocd is killing me lol but i like the game so far i remember that anno 1404 have some achievmnent cheats were we change ship names to famous ship names of cinema or history i cant remmember well now but it was a thing boat name the love boat lol just dated myself this game is beautiful it actually made me go pick up 2070 and 2205 both of which just happen to be on sale super kewl concept now to figure out what gets my cake next lol is it me or the graphic is the same as anno 2070 if you place the farm so the total is 9x9 including the building you should end up with a nice neat square rather than 8x10 with an odd square tacked on why play on increased speed while youre figuring out what to build very unoptimal you need to build soooo many more houses youre going to be playing catch up for the rest of the game if you dont tiny nitpick the audio when selecting peasant houses seems to be quite long its probably fine for a little while but i imagine youd get quite annoyed with it after a few hours im flipping here the potato farm 9 and with 72 81 9x9 why are you doing this to us think about the ocd people please looks great im happy they went historical this time around annos are always day one buys for me seeing partyelite struggle with farm plot placement and layout really really drives home the anno vibe i need this fucking game now use paved roads they travel faster this really takes me back to when i used to play caesar 3 growing up thanks for the video ill keep an eye on this one thanks for the videolooking forward to the next one you can also change the title of the newspaper would love to see some more anno its one of those series that i have been interested for years but anno after anno i have felt that the games arent quite there yet anno 1800 will hopefully be my first introduction to the series as a player i am so happy you show us this game thanks party btw imagine a new commandos game with same graphics 3 coming from bfg2 warhammer tw 2 stuff but i guess ill watch this too frostpunk was the first city builder i really enjoyed but this looks pretty awesome definitely want to see more the fields can stretch to anywhere you want as long as theyre still connected to the farm it is a good way to fill out the areas that are a bit inaccessible or weirdly shaped i always loved soundtrack of anno games it looks very nice you could make the farm 9x9 and include the building not sure i would be into this but its actually quite absorbing more please liking the play through not sure why you are so hesitant to build more houses though i think it would help you out to build a lot more of them britney the advisor most village taverns were near to a church i have been following you on dofm dont forget that this looks a really nice game looking forward to further episodes the fact that the party boat didntt automatically get named for tthe boat is beyond me hey man ive been enjoying your battlefleet vids but anno has been on my radar also so i really liked this one keep up the good work ships name earl of hamberder all that hollow denial of partys ocd while playing dawn of man is coming back with a vengeance anno 2070 was fun however as long playing rts player i eventually realized combat and economy strategies were limited and repetitive anno 2205 shown more of a gameplay decline flood of critics voiced how unexpansive the gameplay was since it was worse and obvious third time around ill be very skeptical especially since its the same developer that made 2205 i think this is the best city building game please continue the series more please this game looks gorgeous get paid to play video games today search for i want video game cash 2k19 in google for more info ill take more of this and bfa2 go crazy in the timber and other stuff also build more houses partyelite you can make a 9x9 potato field which should tuck in the farm nicely 3x3 for the farm plus 8x9972 for the fields this game looks so damn good but let us not forget 1 it is made by ubisoft 2 i see dlc in the menu screen in a closed beta kinda like a reminder not to hype up too much sadly endless party for the flagship looks nice but i hope they can evolve past the basic grid structure seems like most city builders have a hard time with that and theyre losing their luster as pc tech improves wait you also do play this i love this channel o this looks good looks like basically everything i want from an anno game you got to sort your maths bakery you needed two farms for one mill your ocd over the potato farm was funny great great you wait forever to get a couple of logs from your single lumbermill and you wonder why the npcs are ahead of you build a couple more also stop being so anal with population housing you lose so much productivity when you build housing only when you need it and then waiting for the people to fill them have some unemployed bums waiting for new factories to open not the other way around it sounds really fun ill definitely pick up when its released i will be greatly disappointed if the boat is not named boaty mcboatface 81 is a weird number bruh 9x9 whats up with the graphics they look pretty bad in my opinion i just hope the priest of the church is a czech named godwin looks gorgeous defo gonna be buying it talking about city builder type games i havd been playing early builds of foundation and would love to see a lets play what you can do is when you build farms just connect the other wheat farms land for example and it wouldnt be separated visually can you show more military i would love for this series to be daily its such a relaxing game to watch a feeling for aesthetics is not misplaced i like it england really does have an earl of sandwich call it the party drunk im super excited for this title i hope they dont foobar this up this game is gorgeous please continue the series also consider feesthoven as the name for the city or chosen of bacchus for the flagship as you know bacchus is the god of wine and parties and elite comes from latin electus which would be chosen or handpicked watch my infinitely better playthrough instead httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9gvvmwmw22e i hope you enjoy it and just as a reminder you can buy it here if youd like to support the channel and charity as you do httpswwwhumblebundlecomstoreanno1800partnerpartyelite cheers anno 1800 nice love the series fyi the odd ratios of building sizes and fields etc to each other is on purpose it forces you away from the hardcore grid style making for more dissorganized more appealing cities loving this game and the content would love if you tried out oxygen not included its an interesting game you might enjoy is ai still a cheating piece of fuck 3102 unionize what are you talking about no trying to keep the workers down so you can exploit their labor more efficiently eh guvna i notice it took you nearly half the episode to complete hannah goodes unionise quest when usually you do whatever she wants right away hmm flagship name bitcoin oh you have 50k subs congratulation name the town as partyville this isnt bfg2 weird flex but watching this made me realize why i like survival games so much because i grew up with the likes of caesar pharaoh age of mythology and cleopatra games and those have the same resource gatheringadvancement gameplay loop obviously citybuilders are a bit more sophisticated now but this game actually gives me a nostalgic feeling love this period setting too keep the gameplay coming please the boat should be named the party boat so is the closed beta going on now or is this past play omg watching you placing things is frustrating xd just drop the fucking thing and get it done lol afaik its only residences that can catch on fire so whats up every one anno from the future to the past attacking during a carnival i love it haha keralisand than also keralisno and than keralis it is not so wise to do the whole fleet of shipsoftheline every fleet consists of different class ships and each of them has a specific task for example you shipsoftheline has an awkward mobility and could be easily kited by enemy gunboats while if you will need to retreat and save the fleet enemys gunboats will sink you superexpensive ships because they are fast and can shot forwards it would be a wise decision to keep at least some frigates gunboats in your fleet to cover shipsoftheline and seize enemies ships which try to espace for instance i feel like these episodes are mixed up since you built a boxing arena last episode and hasnt discovered it in this episode and you discovered yourself a few episodes ago as well why was episode 6 put behind 5 you started with a couple hundred less people love the series just curious only just subbed because i bought anno 1404 love the grid love your videos is it a reason that you dont upgrade roads i love the smell of dew i love the smell of you too lady gets me everytime stop responding to the npc players it is so annoying and repetitive makes it hard to watch never played any anno game but after watching now im really firedup and want to try it out though its will be hard form e to build something decent d the new world only having obreros as a maximum type of person is lowkey racist saw u in life is feudal you doing great vids omg yes this game needs street view that would be magical imagine being able to walk around with either everything going on as usual or events and productions paused so that you can soak it all in without worrying about progress also being able to go on ships and enjoy the view on deck yes please bluebyte ubisoft thx man im guessing ubisoft didnt give in to your begging everyone is excited for the division 2 but all i want is anno 1800 please upload another video pleeease thank you uncle its been a wild ride gg keralis it would be great to see you continue playing anna 1800 very well organized wanna see how it turns out hey keralis been following your anno series for a while now im sad we cant hear more about lickwick now feels like a onesided breakup once the closed beta ended its good to see you uncle i just dropped in on this episode and is the new world like the orient like in anno 1404 where you need to get resources from the one civilisation to the other in order to progress them this looks like so much fun you claimed zero shares of the conquered ladys island i was expecting more this looks better than the one im trying to play why at the minute 3206 the captain or whatever has the colors of argentina i mean the president of that country used the same thing when assume or do something important i hope they let us build brothels instead of churches cant you take more videos about anno 1800 because your communication with us is very nice to me hmm they made realferas look more luxurious than you we want more i swear to god i have been following you since you created cities skyline series your voice and the gameplay sound like a meditation for me haha am surprised you have not also done some anno 1440 as a further promo for anno 1800 then when 1800s out properly your viewers will see any differences a lot easier i hope it will continue ill wait for next episode i need more episode with your anno 1800 i love it so much love it theres a minor issue on your trade route please click it havent been here since the truck simulator days wow the chanel is still awesome im watching you videos straight please upload moreeeeee your coast lines are so ugly keralis itd have been cool to see the stuff in a museum is this the final episode keralis please play more of this game i like it and i like you too and i cant hear anyone elses voice on this game youre just perfect how do you get those shaders in minecraft is the next episode out already when you make 12 more hop farms than it lets you normally xd 1427 do you know if the multiplayer allow us to colonize the new world as well and will it work the same way single player does watching all the people walk round in circles over and over again reminds me of sandyhook fire station go watch it looks the same dont it keralis you are my best tv show your ocd is like my ocd best luck and waiting for the next episode you are uncle keralis please upload the next episooodeee 3 imagine if you could build the city in anno and then walk around in it in vr stone roads increase the range of services also you need to try different goods for expeditions snaps is medicine bread is faith fur is hunting and so on find them all btw whos that nephew of urs calling u often uncle p oh no i was hoping to see a grand sequel game of anno 2205 as anno 2800 instead of an old historical simulator game like this anno 1800 keralis youre best youve helped me a lot love from bangladesh hello keralis pls anno 1800 episode 7 its very fun to watch 2654 our newspapers are filled with fake news oh so true can you please make more anno 1800 videos its a great game and watching you is greater 214 is it swedish what you said after bon voyage p is this the full game or the demo i love the way you play how you arrange your building so efficient even i try to copy that xd and i hope the zoo filled soon haha im so hyped for this cant wait for the full version it seems that the battle system kinda sucks in this game its also way to easy to gain control of an enemies island just destroy a few cannons and its done you could spend a couple of hrs in anno 1404 to destroy enemies i think the battle system really needs some work in this game fucking gutted that i forgot that i signed up for the beta some time ago and totally didnt know that i was accepted into it so it feels like i totally wasted a beta key which someone else could have used why do you not build a massive ship of the line navy and just bomb everyone back to the stone age holy production chains i thought top tier ecos geniuses in 2070 were involved still this game looks fun and thanks to your videos it looks like ill be preordering this game i think it is about time lickwick has all its roads paved i take personal offense in you not upgrading your roads it will reduce transport times amazing content i really enjoy watching your videos why were u in elis jail mr keralis play more evil bank manager there are many fans waiting for you to play some astroneer please give it a try how did you place more fields than needed dissike for not conquering the island fuck you keralis i hope ull play and make a series of subnautica bellow zero game im gonna so happy btw keralis great to see you uncle can anyone help me im a new player to city skylines how do u plop the growable without destroying the building subscribed to follow this series absolutely love watching you play this beautiful game 3 im so glad that my current boss is plain grumpy nouveau riche not such softvoiced abstergostyle potential villain who was first millionaire weared jeans cities skylines great video as always you should consider playing foundation again now that its on steam early access it has a bunch of new content qing dearly regrets picking on mosquito anno 1800 is a good in deep game also i forgot a name but you are a really good narrator and youtuber thanks here is my like and subscription treat them good xd aqua foley beta end is near thats so fuckn cool you can jump from the new world to the old and the buildings are a different style im buying this game no questions asked not too shabby dear ubisoft let keralis play outside the beta hes literally the only reason i recently purchased an ubisoft product anno 2070 just to hold me over this form of advertisement works so let his soothing voice continue to hypnotize all of us into giving you more of our money let him play sincerely gamers who want to buy this game we want video oncle i cant wait for the game its sad that they moved the release to april but if we get a perfectly running game then the waiting time is worth it i love the time you have taken to show all the aspects of anno 1800 by the way i think the woman is saying i love the smell of dew hey keralis really enjoy your videos of anno cant wait for the game keep up the good work btw you could fix the smokey gulash situation by moving the canning facility to work as a buffer it would mess with the grid a bit i guess but i know you could find a way to make it pretty one thing i want to know is how they went from the early anno games to anno 2070 to anno 2205 now its back to 1800 i take it the next one will set in the future again while qing is dying a painful and agonizing death lets make some beer to celebrate i guess i hope you get to make another episode pls uncle try to make more videos of this series p ps i know what you gona say your not my uncle but xd what happened to workers and resources i bought anno 2205 because of your great streams tons of new dlcs though and the stock market was scary i almost got bought out finally uncle i like youtubers who have calmy voice like you give this man a free code to play the game i am waiting for ep 7 cause i am addicted to ur videos cant watch any other gameplays of anno great vid keralis i really enjoy your anno 1800 lets play vids we want moooooore gr8 content btw if you mouse over the other materials when your doing your voyages it would place a checkmark when you have the right one to go out with like for medicine you could use soap materials you could use ship sailsect 1511 she says i love the smell of dew lmao looking forward to your next episode i love this game and cant wait to get it no buts only asses donkeys love how he thinks she is saying i love the smell of you haha wont frigates be faster than shipoftheline for expeditions keralis voices is so relaxing everytime i hear ladies and gentle men or look at this i skip 20 seconds no buts you will deffinitely have another episode lol anyways ive been a subscriber for i guess half a year and ever content you make is really fun to watch and actually calming thanks man and keep up the good work such a fantastic series i just started anno 2205 and love it cant wait for this too your voice is just turning me onn good to see you uncle cmon arek game is not finished when you built every building in the game d remember minecraft time imagine you built one block of every possible block in the game and call it just do it nicely bushes decorations play with it people love to see your detail working 3 you know the drill you tought me this drill arek the architect d just be happy panda keralis expeditions are not work8ng l8ke that rations are useless you need to take with you ressources who give bonus stats on what is required for that specific expedition for exemple schnaps give medicine stat and planks give crafting all ressources give different stats bonus per unit

to add ironclads ive been waiting for this extra flavour to the gulag finalmente porcodio hey keralis i think the people you can hire from the prison island have additional stats like faith and force to improve your expedition on top of the key benefits of 10 damage could probably try hiring one whos expedition stats are similar to the mission you are attempting in the future upgrade the road pleeaaasee please burn qingqing to the ground youre evil laugh makes me incredibly uncomfortable its always good to have time with your kids good for you i stopped all other viewing cause i saw your name keralis fron what country are you keralis build a massive fleet to show qing who is boss u should have all road upgrade all around the city to look nice youve just earned yourself a new subscriber my good sir kara lis you dont have to explain that you were sitting on the couch with your kids eating candy just say to your viewers that you were busy smudging this is the term we use to describe this peace out brother sending sailors out on expeditions and not even giving them any beer or rum how cruel i love every single video you put out so much passion lookie lookie at my cookie

used to watch the tropico series but stopped when it ended ive rediscovered your channel and this series is amazing keralis plz brick all the roads in lickwivk already you are too too forgiving unconditional surrender princess qing will know the wrath of captain keralis incredible video so much going on pretty sure you covered every aspect of the game that there is from building production farming housing combat diplomacy and exploration what an epic episode well played thanks for the longer episode loving the new anno game featuring winning grid patterns by keralis lol slow smoked goulash is a delicacy after watching the earlier episodes of your anno 1800 series i already liked the way you commentate your gameplay the thing that really hooked me onto your channel though was the but but but but but no buts not thinking about what others are gonna think about what you build or how you do it but just simply doing it oh andi am not your uncle xd so glad you uploaded just got back from the hospital after dislocating my shoulder for the second time in 1 week thank you for the brief distraction from the pain love you man keep up the good work keralis hey keralis think you forgot to destroy qings repair crane which automatically repaired the turrets killing you love the gameplay keep up the amazing work lots of love xx lickwick fursuits are the best fursuits where is banished so exciting today loved the carnival cant wait for you to destroy that woman and her whole city for heavens sake man turn your ships sideways so the cannons can fire and stop having one ship behind the other lol wow i remember watching your dishonored playthrough six years ago i was 11 and i remember staying up late at night watching them at low volume so my parents didnt hear i also watched the whole ets2 playlist you were the reason i bought that game and invested so many hours i cant forget minecraft the hermitcraft series and wife vs minecraft ive shared so many great hours with you through your videos i sometimes tune back in to your videos they are so much more professional im happy for you and your channel from dudley ps i found a comment of mine on the last video of the dishonered 3 i have learned something about strategic games it builds your strategic skills and makes you think very quickly in managing your life i didnt think this would ever influence my life but it does great series this game looks awesome great game you pronounced tortilla wrong and it taste great frostpunk memories i require a 200 episodes anno 1800 playthrough when the game comes out this is gold keralis i havent seen a video from you in years like since hermit craft days glad to be back im really enjoying this series this series is the one that made me come back to this channel nice vid but pls make another city skylines also love the anno series but lowkey waiting for the new subnautica series assuming you will play it since you loved the original game i love this stuff now you fucked up i want all videos to be an hour long great series keralis thx finally a new video 2442 missed perfect opportunity to say why is the rum gone love the videos but you really need to stop with that annoying cringy evil laugh so good to see you uncle i love the smell of june im in hope u will make it to do another one episode love this game just saw this game on steam and hopt back to youtube to find you gona sub watch some of your videos and i like them a lot keralis you do know you can change the newspaper name from anno chronicles to whatever you like right i think you are the nicest guy on the internet and probably the only one who could play the most boring game for hours and i would still enjoy watching it there is something about you just saying greetings from nyc well good sir here is a sub and a thank you for the amazing content also i hope you never get bored of this masterpiece of a game when it releases because i just cant get enough of these videos i am freaking out when he uses more than 24 hours to upload a video much love my polish friends3 104 its a smoked goulash well lesson for the future in case of looting other players islands immediately relocate your ships away from harbor area once you level its defences and then just comeback later on and loot even more especially with late game heavy ships driving your opponent nuts from the other news is there a one more undiscovered map there and i seriously love those expeditions however something tells me that full version ones will required serious preparations in order to success so overall gameplay prospects are very promising but will such promises be delivered only time will tell oh by the way 11 people got recaptured by militia during expedition and put back to prison so now they dislike the video love the long episodes if all those people are out in the carnival whos producing please record more of workers resources soviet republic yes an entire hour of keralis in one episode really hard to watch the whole episode when theyre almost an hour long shorter would be better in my opinion i just want you to know ive bought soo many games because of you and ive loved every single one anno 1800 is gonna be next keralis i love your anno 1800 series keep it up but one thing though tortilla is pronounced like tortiya the double l el elle has a special tone in spanish gracias finally been waiting for this keralis maybe next time no mercy on her completely destroy her settlement and take it for yourself and maybe make it as a safe area with lots of protection and tourism again these are just ideas keep up the great work man a ginger beer a marabou and a keralis lets play anno perfekt where have you been you took more than one day i waited and checked every hour pls pls pls do a lets play of kingdom hearts 3 its such an amazing game and i would love to watch one of my favourite youtubers playing it only thing that makes me really not want to buy the game is the horrible ubisoft luncher uplay it never work and takes too much time to use really wish they would remove that from the steam version as then games like this would be a instant buy love to watch your anno vids we understand why we did not get ant thing yesterday hi keralis im watching your anno play just for few days and i wonder what is your accent very nice btw and you know what im thinking i think you are from the same country as i am on north sea on south mountains sounds familliar please correct me if im wrong just wont to say its nice to hear your voice and keep up the good work wish you best camford goulash you can taste the smokefilled progress with every spoonful what a world you have imagined for us here keralis keep up the great uploads thanks you give me motivation and a happy mood im thankfull mr keralis the double l on tortilla is silence i love your videos about anno where are you come from i love the smell of you looking feverishly for booshes honey where is my superboosh they need to add people to the boats like them climbing sails and loading and firing cannons nobody puts baby in a corner you grew so much on me found you some days ago already waiting every day for a new update keralis in respect of the hungarian language its pronounce is something like gu jasch not and never ever gulasch maybe you will adopt this for later videos a good friend of mine is hungarian and he pointed that thing out very often all the best those parades are the reason why i try to do two ways streets but each time i do it i lose so much building space keralis how many worlds are there in the final version of anno 1800 hey keralis i think the lady in the game ist saying i love the smell of dew d but anyways great series i hope u can keep playing so i can enjoy more of your gameplay at 1053 you sound like reaper from overwatch when he uses his ultimate but great video keralis keep up the awesome work d edit ps keralis you should upgrade your roads to stone i think it would make your town look better d finally the next episode yeeeeaah where is evil bank manager now i want to play this your videos are amazing but please stop putting 5 ads in one video i understand you do this to make money but not 5 its really annoying so you did play a game and no snack escaped your sight awesome video as always keralis i love this kind of games i will relax and sit back and watch owo put all moneys into navy take over the world you need to crush that woman before she lays eggs come on man 4 days for an upload i like the smell of yew trees the lady likes wood has 300000 cash ill take the shares to make more money hey keralis awesome video could you call a ship your uncle or the uncle but you did but your self from jail how did you end up in jail if you select your ships and click on their small picture where the shield is you can set them to agressive and hold position also when exploring some resources like chocolate or wine give diplomacy while alcohol gives medicine only if you equip a full stack 50 of them you should also explore with frigates they are slower then shipofthelines but they have other interactions there when someone buys a share of your island like the gasparov did that means you gonna lose income on that island which is bad also you can gain income from theirs without battle if you buy shares the small flag next to the island name 1 share means 20 so if you buy all of it you can buy the island later love the 1980s beatboxing ive been waiting for ages and finally and plz come back soon you should stream on twich the goulash is from hungary we write it as gulys was looking forward to this vid ah yes smoked smogged goulash yum keralis the youtube gamer who does asmr unintentionally will there be more workers and

satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory the loud house more money so unfocussed and all over the place you said you were getting to the hops for your artisans at home and got sooooo distracted lmao im here for the war this playthough is so calming to watch can you fight battles on land and recruit soldiers wish this was xbox release still cant click on people uuuuughhhhhhhhhhhhhh idk why but we had that ability in roller coaster tycoon eyerollemoji wow stop trying to sell crap to me and do the video downvotes your voice makes me feel safe and like everything will always be ok you are gonna call asian woman qshinf qshing are you fucking serious man wtf is wrong with you i thought u was civilized human being yess still love your high quality gameplay vids how are you liking the game im on the fence love sightseeing with you im waiting for anno to be out very excited having already a designed map of my future city and i stumbled on your videos its a delight i just cant stop even though theres a lot of things i would have done differently but i was uplifted to find someone who loves grids and surrounding buildings with pointless roads my boyfriend who bought as a gift anno for me thinks i should be doing all kinds of other stuff before it gets released and i get sucked into it so hard that id barely notice anything around me think im already there why are all of your videos loading much much slower then anything else new subscriber here love your videos your commentary is a perfect blend of game info humor i love it 127 really love how you laughed 507 just gonna leave that here gold mine but look at those donkeys wonderful graphics like a dream world so far the best youtuber who play anno series because you keralis really care about this beautiful tiny details and such fascinating scenes all over anno games while commenting with your adequate cozy voice and this experience for sure makes our minds feel comfort and satisfied thanks and respect from misr hi i would like to play this game please send me a link to download this game or send me the game to emily gsaan663gmailcom thanks i like your videos but ease stop using that racist asian accent in game its very off putting and its really no need for it asmr voice much or what lol awsome for christ sake i remember sim city and when i look at these sort of games i wonder how long before there is no point going outside of your home lol caoutchouc is latex lol you say no to every request and refuse to use diplomacy then you are surprised at the wars its atlas without the bugs and it works lmao got friends playing this atm trying to get me to play seems like a more bugged reskin of ark and ark was bugged to feck got to love the age of sail the ships look so awesome your camera sometimes is blurry what i miss is the ability to make curved roads and freely rotated buildings you shouldve kept doing missions in order to improve diplomacy instead of starting wars i keep thinking i cant wait to buy this game then i remember it will probably melt my laptop what is that accent sounds sexy eddie murphy coming to america hi best evil laugh ever its to bad that ubsoft has anything to do with it build more defense ffs you have tons of resources this game is beautiful i like to think you stop and stare at the little detailed animations with your mouth agape then realize you havent said anything for a minuet and quickly say im here im here lol speack french plz i love it only thing is that it has some of the drawbacks of sim city with people and cars disappearing or walking through each other and sometimes too many of the same exact duplicate buildings are seen which takes away from the experience but otherwise its fascinating game play whats wrong with ur voice we need upgraded roads in the city uncle please wow this game is super filled with content girt lush is a term we use here in the west country moreso bristol it s weirdly refreshing to hear my native accent i want ready for the great leader moi xd these germans who are responsible for the anno games really pay attention to detail id love to see them make a game in the medieval period or perhaps do the greek colonization of the mediterranean featuring greeks phoenicians egyptians and so on i love anno sightseeing with you 2420 this stuff is bananas i love this videos cant wait to play this my self make double roads to have more space for the walking people keralis please build a great boulevard like champs elisees what is the configuration of the computer keralis make the roads stone i will revenge mosquito this game is so boring and amazing at the same time where are the fucking battles i might as well just play sim city or city skylines i cannot wait for this game have the beta but i not played as i will get so hooked and be upset between beta ending and the game releasing lol plantines are kind of like banana they are larger texture and slightly different taste very big in central american cooking very good when they are fried its a whole new world was expecting dont you dare close your eyes i am simple man i am such nerd look at this really annoying i could watch forever is this gonna be multiplayer i am looking forward to the moment when he actually sails his fleet and takes out the chinese lady dont know if you can conquer their stuff but you have a nasty fight coming up with the rusky looking dude the new rise of nations looks great awesome the busy roads are actually quite accurate the incredible boom of population growth in the old european cities that were not designed for such number along with the rise of the industry caused overpopulation and very unsanitary conditions look up illustrations of paris and london of the 1870s its crazy gustav dores illustrations of 1872 london are lovely still looking for a youtuber that doesnt constantly pronounce a name completly wrong or just deliberately call qing for chingching for some reason seems everyone lets player does this and it annoys me like crazy this is my first comment about this amazing youtuber i didnt like him at first due to it just being so different than most other youtube gamers but wow i freaking love watching this guy hes hands down one of the best youtubers ive ever watched keep up the awesome and very enjoyable work man game on but this lid i love your videos all of them been waiting for this gameplay for a long time and the commentary is just one of the best features for this videos keep up the great work caoutchouc means natural rubber in french those buildings might be on fire but that parade is on fire there are that many people on the road because its the super bowl whos gonna win old world or new need to get new sayings same thing over and over want a bigger naval battle please and no more cease fire please can your enemy destroy chartered ships or did they count as a neutral faction so can u not build curved roads in this game tiny suggestionbuild a fleet of 3 shipsofthe line and 3 frigates and visit the nice people that just attacked your main island and level one of them it might make the ai players hesitant to attack you again keralis once again great work just a small detail if u want to increase the relation with jingching dont spread fake news she likes it rough and uncensored and as u know its all about the details im new to the game and i was wondering if the game is gonna be cheaper when its officially released you can improve relations with your neighbors by doing missionsquests for them click on the gold star at their light houses and start completing the over 2500 quests for favor and gold your missing out on riches and game content i liked the video without even watching the video when the next vidio will upload man that ship of the line is tough great game do not forget to upgrade your important roads this game is actually awesome very nice work waiting for new episodes of this game i am simple man too keralis so more camera shoots and sightseeing pls its a bad joke from ubisoft lickwick as a city name and skulls on the sails when you have unlocked everything and tried out all the buildings you should try to take over alot of island it would be so cool with an all out war with everyone ive seen the videos as i have seen most of your videos i cursed my wife for interrupting me i terrorized the kids into doing something for themselves i think i am very much in awe with this game my wife seems to think so my kids seem to think so i do not care what they think keep posting keralis cannon in public moor you intend to welcome people with cannon fire that would be awesome free pirating experience for everyone not the plundering part of course the getting shot at part please upload twice a day with this series u are just good ni commentary some time that also feel irradiating make your game play little better plz thanx i believe on you that you can do that does road that are twice as wide allow more treading and maybe give your 2nd island some grade of defense the voc had a big army to defend its treading routes in anno 2070 i had 2 islands 1 was where all the people lived and the other was where all the factories and mining went on so the pollution got so bad on the 2nd island the game was basically telling me that no life can survive there but it didnt matter because every1 was living on the other island that was all clean and pretty i cant wait to play this game everything is square its a beautiful gameif the warfare is great i might get it keralis invest more in productionupgrade residential areas and roadsbuild some new buildings and structuresexploit oil and goldtrade with somebodydiplomacy there is lot of things to do my friend dont spend money and resources on war concentrate only on defense and escort i used to watch your channel about 3 years ago and im finally getting into again started watching your videos yesterday and said i was excited to see the follow up and then this shows up godly boring designsefficiencymoneypaworinfluence reapet the process on the next island edit hey you have some clay deposits in the new world and maybe is a good time to find some allies keep the good work cant the add curfy roads you should build a bunch of gun boats and put half of them with one ship of the line and the other with the other half so you have two armadasfleets ok i will buy this got the beta this games amazing build more ships so they wont try to attack you any time soon you earn enough and upkeep isnt that high for all man tropico anno settlers all making a comeback when will the next soviet republic come out love it looks very refreshing cant wait i cant wait to play this love the comments you make and how you enjoy the game fire oh but look at the alpacas alpacas make everything better i would just constantly blow your shit up just to watch you try to build it again i wonder how the conquering part is gonna be like and im waiting to be called as an uncle by an unknown woman 1209 poppy harlow is it you you almost sound like the guy from jurassic park lol great i looooove it two videos in one day we are blessed some nice feedback is this game needs internet connection i got a plan arthur tahitiiiiiiii it is better to link buildings from one to one in a production chain and only final production with the storage i like that you can trade from one world to another and the cash is the same unlike jurassic world gameso far love this game and cant wait anymorewell nice play keralisi like it will this game be on ps4 i really hope so i havent found new games like this for console and i would stick a lifetime into these games keralis we are going to war build 2 ships and call it a force well played i have only just found you since anno 1800 and i must say you have such a nice voice the shape of isabels island is similar to sea anchor i cant help but wonder why you only made your roads one

your voice is so peaceful and relaxing i love your humour so much too hopefully theres those points because youre driving me crazy with your roadsblocks and how even if on many of your lets play where you already played a game from the same franchise and with the same gameplay you still miss some features or dont understand how to handle some situations xd i made be masochist i love you xd keep doing keep going dear cookie never have i screamed more build harbor cannons build fire stations while keralis gleefully ogles all the pretty shinies lol your channel is the best subscription i have done in 2019 can you fast upload sa video and make war for me i enjoy the video however its so fucking racist towards asians when he makes fun of them by doing a funny voice as of how they would sound also pronouncing princess qings name wrong its not qing qing its qing as in a single qing so please stop yourself war breaks out stares longingly at his cookie d that ship of the line looks really unbalanced i wonder if it might be inspired by the vasa nice game thx fried plantains are awesome love your evil laughter you should surround your harbor with a breakwall you should be able to build one by using the quay to extend outward quite far then surround the harbor entirely except for a single opening able to fit 2 or 3 ships then mount guns and cannons on the breakwall placing the strongest ones at the opening i got the idea from my hometown milwaukee and the breakwall we have there arent any guns on it but theres a really cool lighthouse at the opening for ships to go through you should get 4 ship builders if possible and build 4 ship of the lines to defend lickwick on both sides 2 and some frigates if possible turn them into a fleet and on your settlements get frigates and gunboats to protect them i bet it would be hard for them then to destroy you only ones you can afford it though can you play subnautica below zero i hope this doesnt come across as bad but i really like putting on one of your videos just as i get into bed i dont make it all the way through but your voice just relaxes me to get to sleep so i gotta go back and watch the second half of the vids maybe build two more ship of the line battle ships and post them to the other side of your island and build more to protect your other island the ship of the line needs more width to it seems too thin no more workers and resources i love your voice you really need to launch an international broadcast nice game but 60 upgrade the street you need the traffic manager presidents edition mod to help with traffic so awesome i have gone from anno games are not my type of game to i need this game plantain is like a variation of bananas that is very common in southamerica and the caribbean it is not as sweet but it is commonly eaten fried i love your channel tho greetings from colombia i think you need to upgrade those keralis lovely place i just hope they will introduce random generated maps in full release i never comment frequently but this game is absolutely fantastic i hope well get many more videos we can start selling rum tropico 6 flashbacks i want to play this so badly really bummed i missed out on getting a key for the closed beta gonna have to see if i can afford it when the full game is released great series and video keralis its huge and its mine hahahha good to see you uncle keralis mr keralis the plantain is a banana of sorts take a look when you build the fish oil place it looks like you can place one in front of the coastal connected one maybe you can build them outwards that might work with fishieries in the old world too the floating woman at 034 is my favorite animation i thought i saw a clay spot in your new world 4episodesinarow ypu can change your world name by copying linkwick and make ur original name awesome content as always keralis you have a fantastic voice and is quite funny as well its very relaxing to listening to you your citys always looks fantastic as well could you do another dawn of man give away im broke and the game is almost out your content is just sooo relaxing and fun i remember the lets build series on minecraft back in the days just relaxing and rebuilt it like you do with bushes yes you heard it right this is one of the few youtubers where i actually watch the entire video amazing work dude this is the real deal you know what would be nice if the environment around the polluted areas became more lifeless and grey like the trees the grass etc right now it feels a bit off to see green healthy trees right inside the smog build some frigates gun boats are only going to get sunk im in the beta and have played like 8 hours since yesterday cant wait for full release i got stuck and couldnt figure out the new world stuff so i went to war with nearly everyone with about 8 ships and won lol loving 1800 so far i hates 2205 to be honest 2070 was great though next episode can you show us the islands of your competitors nice video very entertaining game seems quite in depth of stuff to do been eagerly waiting lol lovehate your vids good sir sometimes you make me pull out my hair but sometimes you make me spot great games i mightve missed otherwise to add content to this post caoutchouc kauczuk kautschuk is natural rubber milked from trees edit plantain is a type of banana you have to cook first can any body raccomend a good and relatively cheep gaming pc golden behind thats funny nice tribute to francis drake i love the smell of you keralis the way you say princess qings name is pretty racist its not qing qing awesome video keralis looking forward to the next video game looks like fun but 5900 dont think its worth that much no matter how good you make it look keralis by clicking on the characters in the diplomatic menu you get some diplomatic actions to improve relationships frickin poop it down keralis i never played anno nut because of you keralis i do want to get this one btw you can buy the seed hops from one of the island you didnt discover yet from the old world omg this upload just fixed my day soooo hrad omg i was so dow my leg is half brokenactually half broken and i cant go anywhere and i just finished a game of cs with the most toic team ever thank you keralis upgrade them roads maybe that crowd of people were celebrating mardi gras d they had balloons so they seem happy not a riot or something bad caoutchouc is rubber your ships have item slots is that for weaponspeed upgrades he should pave the insanely busy roads in the main town keralis caoutchouc is rubber man that escalated fast cant wait to see the steam ships but they are not buildable by players in the beta sadly could you please make an island completely covered in roads ha ill sit back watch and relax just what i always do when watching anno 1800 by keralis keralis love this series did you know subnatica below zero has early access now and are you going to play that 2253 keralis you forgot to move the gunboat you bought you need more war ships huge keralis fan i didnt know your channel then i saw your first anno1800 episode and i liked it youve got a new subscriber you are the best keralis you need stone roads luving it so much like ahhhhhh these videos always make my day keep it up those fifty minutes for boat building must be in game or if you pause it and come back it will be ready you should upgrade youre roads you should start improving your roads in lickwick downtown i caught myself smiling watching this game amazing you have to build a huge fleet to destroy those bastards please put stone roads on the center of the town for reasons start upgrading roads into the next level since your main island is so much developed especially in that road where all of those people are celebrating it will look like a downtown perhaps keralis you are awesome ive been watching your videos for about 7 years now keralis and i still love them 1010 your incurable add is part of your charm still good beer is more important than fried banana its good to see you uncle dont click read more i love you maan im inlove again in this goregeous game i can watch an island for hours doing nothingthis game is just the best thanks for making very mature and kind videos great video maybe you should build better roads for the crowded city p they need a fred dibnah quote to trigger when you hover over the industry smoke stacks make stone road in the middle of the town wish you bomb rush all the islands before the ai got them 3 before you loving this series so far is at full war with 2 ais keralis well where was i oh yes lets make some ponchos upgrade the roads xd give us more anno any other that likes before watching keralis the very busy road probably needs paving the only thing i remember after every anno video from keralis im not your uncle d keralis just use relocate instead of destroying buildings where you need room also if there is hire a captain that makes your big ships go fastermove around faster hai keralis im from kerala sounds same right luv ur videos i want to play anno 1800 but im using low end pc keralis its episode four and you are already at war episode four and you are already at war way hey hey haha i can imagine that being a pirate sea shanty xx be keralis 8 buildings on fire people panic decides to look at tourists instead using sightseeing mode wonders why there are so many people on one street doesnt upgrade roads anyway all of someones property is begin sent to hell still just adores his city hey keralis just fyi the earl of sandwich was a real earl and also the guy that invented the sandwich hence the name d i thought that krealis himself will be the captain now d im also looking forwad to a new anno but i need

this series i love it some say barry still thinks keralis is his uncle love the evil laugh keralis if it was me i would stop putting all the manufacturing outside the city and concentrate it along the harbor and dot some like tailors and brewers alongside the residential areas that way traffic from the farms and mines can move through the city and make it far more lively i would also practicee and memorize all of the tilesizes for the structures to i can make a grid that can work with all the buildings while breaking up the typical brick stacks grid you big youtubers did me a favor now i dont need to pay 60 euros for this gamethank you i dont know if those videos make the situation in which i am hyped about the game better or worse but i like them and the fact you upload them daily is marvelous omg i still enjoy this so much keralis make more stone roads pls a ship battle cool wow that is a really crowded street at the end lol i waited the whole day for thia vid some nice feedback

game those building for the new world colonization really resembles to the one from tropico series and these two games will come out in the next few months man so hype where is cities skylines i cant wait for the next episode doing great keralis waiting all day for this episode im so excited right now love the series why are you uploading such a beautiful 1 episode per day go 2 3 per day im not your uncle is best part of video d will there be more workers and resources soviet republicks nice video keep up the series love all your series keralis i love it well we all know what its time for d love your vids greetings from sweden first enjoy everyone have the best weekend and hit that like button for more 3 cut him some slack guys just want to say i love your laid back commentary heyi wanted to be continued from episode 2what is this its a ubisoft game its most of the time riddled with bugs its normal keep in mind paying full price enhances the fixing of the game as that will pay their lazy developers dude u need clothing all episode cant u see that lol when you wanna yell build the police station also another clothes maker and fishery i have a theory about raptor i think he plays these games just competently enough to generate interest in them and in his content but incompetently enough so that you watch the video think bah i can do better than that and then go buy the game the way you build houses is painful build a police station you sound like shroud lol i love this series too much 3 just a heads up when you are wanting to upgrade your homes to workers you have to keep an eye on your population literally 3 times it jumped 300 people but you werent paying attention and then it dropped all the way back to 1126 so none of your houses were full 10 people just gotta watch the population fluctuate back and forth you should build a police station and other entertainment buildings thats the reason why your population isnt going up seems like a funnish game itd be nice if there was a tool that would tell you exactly what homes are available to fill with workers like an idle worker button similar to how other rts games would do it to have to go click randomly across all homes looks tedious af 3357 she was happy with u sinking ships and seeing naval battles it was not her ship yeah he probably made all these episodes back to back so yall can stop pointing out the audio delay theres nothing he can do perhaps a park i n t e n s i f i e s i dig the series though coupons more likesocialism lol i wish i can play this game the sound is faster than the video did anyone else hear that one worker i love being oppressed fantastic i really like your videos and the way you narrate is the game released is it available in india i think that the flowers were there at 1924 bottomleft of screen there are golden arrows pointing at the base of the mountain 3334 try sailing behind the enemy to left and shooting then cutting right kind of zig zagging behind enemy they will be forced to continue forward without firing or cut and turn to fire either way against harder enemies should save you damage it would be nice if you hovered over or went by the enemy once in a while so we can see how fast or slow you are to the computer ai also build some damn wood first thing in any society food and building you know a house aka workers are just 2 fking wood you should be using all resources to buy enemies wood and building yours up love the play through though every time i think of buying anno anything again i watch these and remember nothing has really changed lol is there a way to make huge maps or are they all confined like this from game series almost 20 years old the soundtrack of this game is awesome the best ive heard it seems raptor was guilty about all the pollution he caused with the iron factories he barely showed that place after they became operational lol loving your vids mahn if i remember processed good factories pick up stuff directly from raw manufacturer that is why some building have a small range you seem new to anno a beautiful and exciting game but the naval combat is absolutely atrocious for a navaloriented game i here a noise like when your building houses the noise to place them down comes before you do it and yes iv check if it was just my head set shroud can i play anno 1800 offline personally i would destroy a few homes to make them populate the ones that are almost full but hey just my 2 pennies is it just me or is the audio kinda messed up i need this game if you want to expand your farmers house you need more fish and more clothing as the bar shows it you sound like combination of reformist and lionheartx10s voice lmao i subscribed becoz of your voice too xd dude why arent you playing the exact way i want you to this isnt about your enjoyment its all about me was i the only one yelling beer they want beer for 30 minutes of that video the crates are in the mountains games similar like this exist also on ps4 if so which one is this game work on mac youre ocd ppls worst nightmare my dude enjoying the vids keep em coming love the videos hate the audio desync first time playing anno you need more fish and clothes thats why you cant upgrade the farmers its hard to watch this you dont look at the signs make sure you brand your soap pears soap think the only issue ive seen so far is everything is in grid simcity4 style if only we can build curve roads quay love the fact that she says i want a rare mountain flower and he keeps looking at the city like u smort also when u looked at the mointains the arrow was there at the bottom of ur screen u just for some reason didnt rotate the audio sync is killing me wait am i tripping isnt this game supposed to come out in april sound doesnt go along with video just me or audio delay how do you play this game before its released im here screaming at my screen for him to do the quests ugh my stress level is going through the roof about it it looks like a remake of caesar 3 but with more beautiful graphics and i mean that in the nicest possible way c3 was one of the best games ive ever played whats the easiest way to gain early access to this at 3707 you cant finish the quest because you missed sampling the loot from the wreck they need more clothes m8 i watch you just because of the game you are annoyingly bad at the game you are enjoying it though peace i havent seen episode 4 yet to see if you got it sorted out but houses wont fill until all of their needs are being met most of the houses you built from 20 minutes and later are short food and clothes without enough they will never fill and evolve several houses in your farming enclave are missing access to the market as well i can waith to see some o the big buildings like the zoo keep up the good work protip you really need to increase clothes and other kinds of production and spread out more markets to distribute the goods around your growing town your pops are actually getting to numbers where 1 market or 1 clothing factory and so on doesnt suffice anymore other than that great job so far what are the mines in the northern mountain right above the church when you click on the houses those little blue bars are their needs and must be full in order to upgrade them you need lots more fish and clothing for your farmers otherwise more will never show up because you arent producing enough goods aswell as some are out of range of the original marketplace when you click on the quest the location flashes on mini map build police and start to build a navy i like this game thanks for sharing this game with us i hope you do more of this please dont stop you know you can upgrade your storages hey raptor i think you need another fishing port plus sheep for wool to working clothes anyway i love your videos loving the series but the audio is a head meaning the noise comes on before u do something this series is my new favorite keep the vids comin raptor do you know how to mass produce towns i love this series no homo though is anyone else getting lag from the game and audio you need a couple of police stations to help bring your happiness up and maybe one more fire department your audio is kinda behind and try restarting the game usually when you click a quest it will lead you to the exact location or ship it might be bugged for you at the moment with over 2500 main questline and more individual quests from your townfolk displayed with gold stars as well as multi player online where you can assist friends with naval battles this is a must have for me im surprised that with yo being so fascinated by the harbor that you havent built a stronger ship raptor i really enjoy the new anno series keep it going and if you can do at least an hour or an hour and a half that would be optimal do anyone notice his stock market crashed from 200 to 35 i just got the closed beta myself and the game looks amazing great content mate keep up the good work this isnt for you mate this game is out of your league you play in extremely boring style you killed anno dude u need more clothing so the whorkers homes can fill up there is a button on the right side of the bottom toolbuild menu that has a picture of a house with and arrow pointing up that is a way to easily show what houses can be upgraded my city would call wesselburg raptor if you press the u key it should show you what buildings need upgraded easier you are so silly the quest of princess said that flower grow over the mountain keep em comin these are great i havent finished the episode yet so i dont know if youve resolved the issue or not but i think the quest objectives might be hidden in the foggy part of the ocean you havent unlocked yet small truble with population perhaps a brewery might help hi raptor i am new here i was starting watching your vids today i like your videos and your gameplays i realy like this game but i like the music dont stop making videos how can i get early access to this game please report to me can you do a livestream on anno 1800 plx that a request two industrial buildings burn down next to oil fields my opinionits obviously americas eagle laser eyes great work as usualkeep up the pace manyou have inspired me to launch my channel check it out i were waiting for this xd and i am the first one that never hapend i couldnt save game file why mine keeps lagging and crashing the issue has been fixed about two days ago no one should be experiencing this issue after updating the game through steam edit whoops didnt read the announcement fully the patch should be out in a day or two on steam epic throwing money left and right because otherwise noone would even go into their store except for misclicks another fix is dont own it on steam or just forgot to buy it ahahahahaha fuck me enigma a corn farm enigma b glassmackers enigma c pearl farm enigma d charcoal kiln coal mine enigma e plantain plantation enigma f sailmakers enigma g clockmakers keep found the grid layouts heey keralis first of all its awesome that you play anno 1800 d do u maybe remember which mapseed and what typearchipelago snow flake etc etc d of your world u have taken are you still doing a giveaway for the anno 1800 deluxe edition archibald i didnt say orange ive been looking for this game on steam it doesnt seem to show up has it out lived its popularity or what im getting all moist that cracked me up you just got a new sub i really love this game but i got problemi cant load my last game i dont know why but your voice is awesome where are you from have to say that i dislike the way they show the influence of building like the market i liked it more when you saw the hole circle any chance this is coming to ps4 do you smell it in the air i can see it at the horizon a new pc with an awesome graphic cardand a new wife or none for a time epic store exclusive from 16th of april i cant explain how long ive been looking to find a youtube that loves grids wowtalk about a slow af start this looks exactly as the 1400 version and that sucked so hardy you said taters you rock the bob ross of gaming i like it 72 individual squares of farm instead of 5 2x3 farms sold honestly my only objection to the game is the fact that in the 1800s there are this many unsettled fertile islands also i would gladly take any of those islands is there land units in this subtitles in spanish please hate the ui right off the bat looks like a cheap unity interface has no character at all and whats with the town name tag hanging down in the middle of the screen nothing but annoying anno 1404 is still the best effort although the graphics in this game are somewhat improved so basically 20 years later anno efficient city is gridpretty city is completely inefficient mind blown but wallet fat 8o nope i tried but couldnt get past that ridiculous accent is this better than foundation nice feedback wonderful grafhics your voice is soo chilly incredible the workers profile looks a bit like post malone returning from way back in the minecraft days to see what youre up to how does population work in this do houses come with people or do houses only get filled up when there are enough jobs for newcomers is there unemployment what is your problem you have too much potatoes where do i download this game banished author should receive royalties on this bro the only reason i watch ur content is because your voice sounds nice 3 i so freaking love this game and the way you play it keep it up and if you come by a giveawaythink of me i mean its about efficiency and gridlocked citys look much better once bigger i love anno series but 60 euro is to much i cant wait for it i pre ordered it on steam holy molly that games looks amazing you cannot repeat the cursed language of the fox it was banished in 2012 it doesnt look like barcelona for a simple reason our grid instead of having a square shpe its octogonal you can check it with satelit mode in google maps grid layout simple and works i love that you take the time to enjoy little details in the game like kids playing in the streets your gameplay videos go so much further than just how to play and its a pleasure to watch thank you yea this looks all very nice all anno parts did but what about the performance all annos became a pain in the ass to play close to and above 10000 citizen on an average system just picked anno 1404 yesterday because this game looks so good appreciate your work on this keralis thanks for sharing 2648 wtf lol never played anno but it does look cool the blueprint mode was a great addition its the one feature from banished id hoped would make its way into city builders en masse oh i can hardly wait to play it how to get early access no offense but you kind of remind me of bob ross especially the accent kill all the wild life and be happy about it best game quote ever you sound like antonio banderas oh my god sorry but i was watching a streamer i like play this and he didnt know anything about anno so seeing your efficiency is better than sex right now the speed you set your lands up wow like oh loads of like from me d gridsystem for the win i love the fixed sun shadow grids are good too plus keralis has the best sexiest voice its like asmr strategy gaming hate grid layouts those people know this is anno right anno grid layouts only took them 10 years to fix the farm placement better late than never i guess our playstyles are so vastly different i play much more reactionary xd i usually try to have districts like i tell myself okay i want the farms out of town then i go alright ill put a warehouse so they can store stuff some houses so theyre close to work and then ill gohmm they would probably want a church possibly an inn and a brewery and it just keeps going from there never played anno just from city management games in general keralis your videos r the best appreciate the awesome vids which game would you say is easiest to start anno dawn of man citi sky frostpunkbanished which few are easy for beginners please let me know when u can again appreciate ur vids i looked forward to them keep em coming ty fun fact about the name lickwick in anglosaxon times villages with the wic or wick suffix were those connected to the production of salt from nearby saltwater or by mining ancient deposits of salt so your town is a salt lick this is just 1404 but 20 times more expensive to much fanboying this anno look really nice what does the fox say me stop saying my password i opted for a closed beta for anno 1800 i never played a sim like this i have no idea what im doing i didnt even know about grids my city is just so badly designed and im getting diseases fires you name it i watch the way you design your city and it is just remarkable youve given me a lot of ideas i really like the way youre into the aesthetic of the game and you are enjoying yourself i smashed that sub button because i too am a passionate gamer houses on fire hmmm they need a park at this time good old keralis its time for a pork buns reumion on the forest new stuff to build i love the smell of jew anyone who designed a city in real life you need circles and squares keralis no only symetrycal grids the developers have no idea about how rigging works those settlers are definately early adopters of new technologies the children allready have helium filled latex balloons quite something considering that helium was first discovered in 1868 so giving it to children for entertainment in the same period is quite a statement im new to the game and i was wondering if the game is gonna be cheaper when its officially released this game is not just city building it has over 2500 quests click the gold stars on those island lighthouses and watch for gold stars in your city for quests also grids make the city look lifeless what manually sending firefighters not watched you in awhile now but you still dont disappoint me on your content the graphics the mechanics the level of detailsim wet barcelona is catalan please pronounce it in catalan barcelona and not castillian barthelona please and thank you love his voice its so british voice i ever heard you have such a nice and unique style of narrating its as if bob ross didnt paint pictures but narrated gameplay footage lol youre like the video game bob ross with your soothing voice and such im all relaxed in my chair while you serenade me with a pretty little housing and we can paint that timber production right there happy little uno mas is this game a lot like the old city builder series from sierra like ceasar 3 pharoah zues and emperor i am not familiar with anno at all im very very like this game and a like your contant and voices good luck to giveaway guys and watch this video the island is called fish head in englishin finnish its kalap why do shadow angles move as the player rotates the camera is it weird that it makes me crazy this game looks so amazing great vid keralis really enjoying this content the game looks great but the fact that the shadows follow the camera position annoys me more than it should one thing i dislike in this game is the fact that streets can only be built on rectangular way no turns with different radius oh my gods i am in love i would love to enter the game give away but i will not get a twitter account just to do it i really love your videos and your personality keep up the amazing work so now the release date is in april please guys no more delays you were really emotional during this lol cant really blame you though its so fucking beautiful cant wait to get it when its out ive preordered the boxed ce i cant wait for it i love this game i seen your videos i was wow i have to have this i go to steam and i am like oh its ubisoft so got to be a catch and there it was denuvo i guess i will not be playing this after all you have such a calming voice that im coming to your videos to relax also the game looks very interesting even though i prefer cities skylines type of city builders 0120 he believe hes a panda hes not with his voice that sounds hilarious im watching these in reverse lol this is my first time ever seem anno 1800 i really really really hope this game wont sucks i want to play the biblical god in this game is it possible to ask the population to worship me otherwise i would send them a tsunami to punish them for not obeying me this game looks and feels like a proper anno game ive played it since anno 1503 which also was my favorite game of the franchise to date the more modern ones always felt to cumbersome the mechanics werent well rounded the 2070 anno was in my oppinion the worst one to date this feels back to the roots it looks fantastic but you can see that it isnt one of those games that use their graphics to halo over lazy game design i love the production chain menu it looks much more intuitive then previous titles menus what im curious about is how the trading and combat works ive been a fan of the 1503 combat system in which you had to research units each unit would have strength and weaknesses it felt well done and proper maybe a little bit to much micro on the transportation of troops im rather tempted to get myself a tower pc to play this game why cant i listen to this voice xd instant subscribe mighty fine videos kalap means fish head lol what i never thought ill day this to a dude but his voice is so orgasmic lol newer barcelona maybe much of the city was rebuilt to a more modern plan the old city my favorite part is all narrow windy streets intended to channel invading armies into kill zones while citizens are on the rooftops throwing rooftiles on their heads those guys knew how to have a good time ive never heard of this game until i saw it on your channel and honestly i am in love with it its absolutely gorgeous im going to get the game and just watch the nature maybe add a little bit of civilization too but thats not important you could tell in the techtest that this could be arguably and eventually the best in the series attention to the little localisation details enjoy i love how you can even propagandize your newspaper this game looks great would love a copy of it and definitely looking forward for more videos keralis thanks for making such great videos you are number one in my opinion am i the only one who always hears keralis 1 maybe two and some other voice maybe 3 maybe 4 what are you trying to say its at 1655 p i was heart broken when i saw that i was a day late then i saw the good news on twitter hopeful to get a key just got twitch affiliate and in celebration i have a 12 hour stream this weekend this could make for a great addition to that anno man this will become gud gud game jawoll it really makes me miss age of empires i mean classic back when it came out aoe i know i could just load it up now but modern gaming has ruined it i need to be back in 95 again playing it for the first time death gimme my youth back first of all i must say that the game looks really really nice on the other hand they made the roads with a thick line of grass in the middle which is typical of the modern era of cars the horses in the horsepulled carriages would have destroyed that part of the road too so they were simply dirt roads until approximately the middle of the xx century thanks lindybeige for pointing that out in one of your videos so we had one day to get the key xd ive been craving for a continuation for anno 1404 and perhaps a venice version after a while for so long now anno is by far the best citybuilder i have ever played the 2070 version i tried out but i didnt like it at all i have a soft spot for the earlier ages when it comes to citybuilding you definatly got a sub from me i love the dawn of man lets play aswell hope to see you try other citybuilding games as they release more betaversions keep up the good work ps i totally agree with you keralis the astetics are what drags me into a game like this i could watch it for hours just the simple man going about hes chores through the day and the wildlife living of the lands 3 kalap fishhead fishhead nice work bro always eager to watch your games schnaps op the best simulation game in 2019 i cant wait for this new sub by the way i love this game i watched every single episode of the anno series and i cant get bored of it you build is way too much symetrical its not realistic imo but its your thing your voice is so relaxing i can tell the joy in your voice it is refreshing and uplifting enjoyed watching your vid and subbed edit but those shadows would drive me crazy hahaha keralis im focusing on aestetics me sees loads of squares in a symetrical shape house flipper god id love to get my paws on this kinda wish it was not on a grid cities centers from that period have more variation love the grids lol love itthe game looks great love the grids nice game with good voice i have anno 1800 ready for the 31st can not wait to explore i want 40 episodes you hear me lieutenant do not make me have you watch the poop deck i love your videos do you have still a beta key your voice is so annoying love the anno games way to go buddy keralis i had no idea there were so many awesome beautiful games out there till i came across your page thank you for the videos and passion playing i have such a long list of games i need to buy now i shouldnt watch this really stop fuckkkk okay ill install 2070 and i cant wait to play a game coming out in 3 months gr8 anno anno never changes you can get moist but be ware cos we dont want you pc to short circuit love your grid layouts i live in barcelona so i can only love grinds if she has a summer garden does she have a winter garden is beta always start on island not possible with only flagship to choose island alone ohhhh i cannot wait i got into anno at 2070 especially with the cosmetic mods i enjoyed 2205 although it doesnt really have replay value after a while and im really looking forward to 1800 d grids are beautiful and practical both in games and reality this game is amazing i hope it gets mods it would make this game a dream when is the game finally coming out your voice and this gameperfect combination watching you is like watching a kid run around a toy store lol when i started watching the video i was very meh but your excitementenergy level has me rampped up at this pointthink ill be looking into buying this one might grab 2205 in the mean time a new change in the ai behavior too which i think wasnt in the previous version the people look at the fire and freak out and stuff pretty sure we saw them chilling out in the pub while there were fires all over the city in the previous video its also kinda cool how adjacent buildings of the same type join up together to become one single complex mebbe try for a massive industrial complex all in one building sort of just thinking about the real world logic behind placing the pub and the marketplace side by side makes me laugh get em drunk so they buy as much as possible or they go on a shopping spree regret the hell out of the spree and go get drunk winwin either way i dont know why the shadows move with the camera but i love it dont know why again its like we control the sun or something great video cant wait to play man with all the respect your voice is really relax to hear hahahaha good job best wishes from brazil you pronounce schnapps like a german so if i understand right how that works you are officially a german now grid or not youre the one playing the game i just enjoy watching you play i didnt notice the shadows until he mentioned it then it started driving me mad d you have the weirdest rhythm and pronunciation to your speaking and mumble a lot im a fluent english speaker and only by concentrating hard i manage to understand about 90 of what you are saying the other 10 are still lost to me do lumber mills need firestations i just have to say that i have watched almost all of your videos on all the annos you have done along with pretty much every city building games i also kinda use your layout for some of my city building games it works amazingly youtube randomly recommended your preview video to me and im glad it did i will be tuning in for this series cheers and prosperity his voice is so calm lol closed beta huh could have put that in the title plz can i have a key the only game i play is lol because its free is this tropic 6 the houses are on firelets build them a parkthey will be happy d its just the same as the other anno games nothing new to see here seriously though is it possible to build curved roads grids are modern i love this game ive played the earlier versions of it oddly i picked it up in a bargain bid and loved it i hope i enterered correctly i never used twitter before so i hope i did it right even i dont win anything can someone tell me if i did it right how do you build anywhere did they remove the restriction on having to have a warehouse to increase your buil area the voice this give me chills ok but when is the next episode this game looks incredible but tbh it makes me a bit uncomfortable that we dont see them construct the buildings the details is fantastic man i love your accent if u is a english teacher i will please to join ur class bro and i heard people really hate gridlayouts so know what we are going to do a gridlayout never change keralis people hate grid layoutoffcourspeoplemost of them hate most sistem of organization and efficencyfor most wastefull sistems are goodto hell with the most people and the parasitic life form they arelove your grid sistem 3 so sad im not using twitter graphics are eerily same as 1404 the true successor to 1404 i bought the game on steam and didnt see that i couldnt play it before april d grids is the only way usually i dont care that much about graphics but this looks great how awesome would it be if you could actually run around in ur city amazing game and your playstyle suits it very well this is absolutely beautiful i love the attention to detail cant wait for a chance to play when will ep 02 come out really enjoy the commentary man i also have 2 keys to give away if your interested just comment this comment and add drayne on uplay i want it now am i watching bob ross gaming channel finally thank you oh please i need more anno 1800 dont stop dont eat dont sleep play more what is your oppinion on the ammount of workers at eg the timber stations etc imo there are too many of them and this makes it a little bit unrealistic in relation to the houses you have more pleas no offense to anyone else i saw many people uploading lets play of this but no one does it like keralis he exactly builds and plans like me maintaining perfect symmetry segregating all different productions though i would like the farm area separated and like farmers houses over there only like a small farm village rest the port area all workers houses and then some kind of separation between the big central city and rest of the island can we do a multi platform thing in this gamelike a big city build of huge huge platforms with each platform dedicated to a class of people big straight highways in all four direction to small small farm and mine towns it would be fantastic and soo beautiful to look at fast fast more i wanna see more since 19 hrs i am waiting for next episode fast bro fast fast fast fast hurry i want to see moreeeeeeee spot on with that island sounding finnish kalap fishhead hi your videos are so nice greetings from turkey this game looks freaking amazing 3 im a sucker for a village city builder when you pronounced the town name i thought hm sounds frenchprobably french then i sees the town name oh i cant wait 50 days lol my favorite youtuber playing my favorite game series i love it wow looks good i loved the anno franchise when its not in the future lol i didnt know there was a beta but i did sign up hopefully ill get an email as usual you were great keralis you could do a video on the end of the world happening yet you are soo calm hehe i dont get this game why do buildings just pop up out of nowhere in a normal city builder people actually build the buildings disclaimer ive never played or even seen gameplay of an anno game in my life haha keralis you and your grids you must have a little bit of german in you keralis they all seem to be more advanced then me keralis zooms in on every waterfall do you know what an artist and a sniper have in common 130 are the storks which pooping babies pls play oxygen not included 3 such a beautiful game i am sure you made many catalan faces sad the way you pronounced barcelona d your voice is so soothing i always end up with a fine and perfect grid layout in games like this even if i try not to make them ha ha do not remind me for human centipede i mean that movie was gross interesting and kinda scary at the same time godamit 30min episodes are no long enough i was just getting hooked on this game please do more episodes unpopular opinion i love grids but please stop butchering them with leaving 1 tile spaces everywhere xd jk great videos cant wait for more keralis qing in chinese is actually pronounced ching ching

anno a day come on guys anno is a grid game hes back go on keralis my son lovely video mate when you mention that each people have their own work compared to anno 1404 where they only acted as gold

i really the only one who notices the shadows act weird on trees when you rotate the camera s please give me that love your videos more banished i want to see more of the town on the lake game looks sooo amazing so much work on animations i dont have twitter any way to enter the giveaway otherwise in the video you can see the prision island in 2910 you see military troops and any watchtower maybe

future great to see anno back i have seen your new anno video in the feed you mention closed beta checked out my emails i got a close beta d are u posting daily this is awesome i just know this series is going to be awesome youre soothing voice and silly gameplay paired with this game is the perfect combination haha inb4 complaints about the grid finally is here people would enjoy grid layouts if they had to live in a city that was planned by someone who thought of a city like it was a spiders web we have small triangular pieces and weird angled roads in lots of places with offset intersections let me tell you traffic is a pain in the a edit keralis i dont have a summer garden and i want a summer garden who cares about these houses i want gardens new series yesssss one two or joins with your friends again ohhhhh si awesome ive been waiting all day for you i hope i get the opportunity to play the closed beta if not i cant wait to play this game when i gets released all right hey keralis i hope you are having a great day didnt he played this few days ago i wish you could do another minecraft vid with a building mod that is what i was lookin forward to see on ur channel 3 u are my fav like this game what happened to sokar my guy never clicked so fast in melife is this the full game do you have full access ohhhhhh loooooooord im firs comenatary first love this yes yes yes love the game so what happens when you play multiplayer the first person gets the big island and everyone else is screwed d i wish there was more visual side to it like us receiving new buildingsbuilding looks or nice decorations etc it should be more rewarding you help me really thanks nice review im trying hard to like this game but i just hate it its so boring ugh artisans need sewing machines great video thnx and lets start a petition for the steampunk idea youve got my vote if im honest i turn other competitors and pirates even off because id like a nice chill build session sometimes i turn it on but most of times not so this dlc kinda seems perfect for me to be clear the new content is accessible outside of the campaign mode right thanks for this its nice to enjoy the game vicariously until a steam release there are a lot of easter eggs in cape trelawney any new buildings or anything question how are you making 16k income im barely scraping by 15k lol kinda dissapointed there are no other work tiers added looks like cape trelawney is based on gibraltar with the battle of trelawney being the battle of trafalgar and la corona being the spanish even though oliveira is portuguese and refers to it as a coroa la corona or the crown in portuguese these two empires did actually merge at one point and then split again so it makes sense still no good ships for expeditionzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz cool thanks for another great review darren your the best nothing wrong with anno having a build chill session the big question i got over the video is how does this fit in multiplayer the big irland is super strong the little stories are cool imo and you can kick of the ai really fast but players build a shit ton of defense buildings the only problem is multiplayer only one can settle the big island but i usualy play with two friends wow a steampunk annoo sounds like a great idear how does the dlc work with multiplayer if only one player could get that massive island it seems very unfair great video a steam punk anno would be awesome awesome review a little concerned with the scrap price otherwise i cant wait to jump in any chance you might do an anno 1800 multiplayer session on stream once nice overview well done this dlc will make me play again the huge continent is what i always wanted seriously guys this is the best city builder since skylines this is basically what if the old sierra games were made in the modern day its just so good and who doesnt love loot in their city builders who doesnt love having custom ships thanks to slapping armor mods on them edit the spoiler territory is from 617 to 724 its nearing the end of the month please consider supporting me on patreon im struggling a bit to keep things going and trying to figure out what direction i should take the channel in if people have suggestions please let me know httpswwwpatreoncomrepublicofplay 106 that castle looks dope is it just decoration or can you do something with it still havent tried anno but looks good great video what cpu and graphics card to you need at the end of the campaign with huge populations on 3440x1440 this is the game of want to

between high graphics and ultra high i can even say that i dont see any difference i have about the same system but i have a video card 1080ti what do you think if i do overclocking then fps will rise to play on ultra settings 4k maxed out19fps and with no aa still just 50 fps goddam thats with an rtx2080ti thats the fastest gpu on the planet and still that low fps my god nothing faster exists i have 55k population running i9 with nvidia 2070 8gb 16gb ram basically a 2500 gaming pc everything maxed out drop in frame rate stupid really thats always been a problem with strategy games now i have to lower settings to compensate hiw dumb this game looks cool would my pc run it uts ryzen 5 vega 8 8gb ram where my anno civilization ultra high bofore the snap high after the snap damn this comparison required a lot of game restarts id like my computer alive i play on low sorry i broke i just ordered a custom built 5000 pc and youre telling me that i cant even play this at 60fps on ultra this game was such a bummer a 4 episode campaign and a sandbox what a ripoff just in case it is interesting for someone im running on i73770k gtx 970 oc 16 gb ram in 2k resolution on high settings with vsync enabled tearing is horrible and 4xaa and it runs with like 4060 fps depends on what you are looking at in the game but it makes a lot of fun just imagine how well this game would perfom if it wasnt crippled by the drm anybody know what fps i can expect with geforce 1070ti intel i77700k and 16gb ram 1080p i can not afford this game i play the game on ultra high its better to find a good compromise between middle and high while ultragraphics are really really beautiful to look at especially the caribbean biom with its palmtree filled island blue water and waterfalls from the mountains in the back the actual game play does not need such fancy graphics i usually play on maximum details on an i97980xe with 128 gb ram and 2 1080 ti graphics cards with frame rates ranging from 30ish to 150ish though the last couple of days during easter i was at my parents house attempting to play anno 1800 on an old pc which had a geforce 650 or the like no ssd and i guess 4 gb of ram my parents use this pc just to write emails and to download new cooking recipes so no need for upgrading the system for now the game actually loaded to my surprise and was playable but the loading times were abysmal roughly 10 minutes to start the game and 12 minutes to change maps all with minimal details imo it didnt look that bad to start with and except for the loading times i had fun playing this game even without f wow i need to upgrade my computer im running low streets are empty i dont see difference between high and ultra just more piece of grass added i rather put a knife in my eyes and be blind than play on low lol if i cant run this game then i will play only in the future not worth playing with crap look like that what about ultra high without aa for me high looks best 19 fps on ultra high in postcard mode the hype is real low looks awful 19 fps on ultra with ryzen 2700x and rtx 2080ti wtf why does the water reflections on low look better than high d im watching the video on 720p monitor 3 years ago you guys were triggerd at that you guys suck at comparing photos comment i laughed soo hard then you guys replied we suck at comparing images this is only one of our videos do you even watch our videos then everyone replied calm down candyland lol um what 19 fps with a 2080 ti finally a game where settings means something apart from lose a ton of fps for nothing of gain but probably the most unoptimized game ever existed and there are some jewels out there i will be playing on low with my 2 gb vram but high looks tasty 19 fps on 2080 ti ok ultra high here is staggering candyland if you get time can you do a test for me dx11 vs dx12 at 4k with the ultra high preset please this music i love it more than the game xd another game that could run far better on dx12 but nvidia put its finger on why dx11 why not dx12 holy shit at the number of npcs shadows and detail in the ultra high examples whoa it almost feels like you can go into fpstps mode at ground level and be okay why does the thumbnail look so similar to anvils architecture from oblivion 130 that difference was just staggeringfirst we have a coach a little child playing and many people and then it changes to a 3 pixel lady dancing does it even run with dx12 or vulkan api please stalker call of pripyat low to ultra in dx 11 pin this if you love youre fans jk u wont hooray for herpes lol i dont like the shipping clipping which you could fix with the ferries in skylines but to do that you had to make the pathways for them so they wouldnt cross over each other but i guess in battles where you need to move different ships in dif directions it would be very hard for the game devs not to make the ships go through each other 1620 wtf oh the big gun destroyed thats nice you didnt fire at it no bullets are seen hitting it yet it exploded must be another damn glitch in your favor this time no skill to you though island name lostmycar cay how is he still playing although the beta has ended i want to play too this games very saftig the 1 o7 so they have now decided to pull it off steam onto epic store fml ship name warspite the nrf victory the new name that i am proposing for the battleship is the nrf indestructible for the heavy defended island i propose the name delos unsinkaboles nrf tirpitz for the dreadnought just look at my names made previously name the battle ship courageous i dont understand whats happening here name the new battlecruiser nrf iowa you could use those pirate flags you have in storage to attack jeans ships without consequence for the new ship raptorprise new world fort island name puerto raptoria other island names fort teranus port carole new hamiltowne pork island should be renamed as either of the ff porkshire porkborough porktown porkton porkville 3rd battlecruiser can be named as the ff vigorous vulture bashful velocity new battleship could be money talks love the vids cant wait to see when you can go full game but loving the series so much you should name the new ship nrf nassauthat was the german response to the dreadnought and the 3 forts could be fort oceana fort odin and fort isla numblar jurassic park island you should name the battle cruiser the darksaber raptor i really wanted to build a beautiful city pans over a sprawling lagfest of houses and shops timed it perfectly name one of your ship of the line new raptorias revenge lol 1200 those ship of sail wouldnt have lasted that long against those dreadnought name for new ship the cliche one personal thing id like to express in my opinion you do too much military when you compare these episodes with the first ones i just prefer the first few you agnolaged the beauty of the game much more also because of the focus on youre military youre cities warehouses are filling up you forget too place police station so riots like in the last episode can happen the list goes on i really love this series but i wish you would not dedicate every episode too war and military build up but also to espanding to the conquered islands or fortifiing youre economy again no hate just good meant criticism long live raptoria ships names relentless nemesis endevour enterprise new island name sandy island like where i live 215 likes out of 1744 views is 1233 so 1233 give a like and 8767 dont give a u know d darn i should voted the bay of pigs would of sounded cool victorious for the new ship lov the vid please somehow fix the economy it is really sad to see the great raptoria having negative income while random youtubers small city has 5000 income keep up the series make a dumb amount of yes mr raptor you are right you have 1648 views and 203 likes the math does not add up you are awesome enjoy your game play keep the vids coming thanks island

cruiser from sir archibald blake so can you name it nrf fortune or good fortune please with a cherry on topplease raptor you literally had 2 repair cranes already but you were to oblivious to that so you built 2 more and basically continued to only use one at a time that makes a lot of sense lmao why female voices on ships thats dumb im a 1r side noteyou have 2x repair crans on that dock next to that pirates base next time you aquire another one of the flaming ammo ships call it dragons bain did he forgot he got another crane sitting on the dock 2300 two cranes look a bit further up on your first pier 3 ps i support finishing off the second pirate base howeveri think you should end it on that high note pirates prevailthink its a sign that a pirateship is on its way out on the seas and finalyraptor got herpes name for the new battleship hercules do recommend this game for an war rts fan do you think that this game is worth 60 bucks and is it the ultimate sandbox game name the new battleship the tyrant hey raptor great videos and like the video or eles hip hip hooray for raptor or eles open waiting for this episode old day long bank thank raptor your welcome man raptor bro its time to start a new campaign im as much of a fan of this game as the next person but this is played out its over a new playthrough for anno 1800 im liking the game so far and really hoping this is basically 1404 but better what do you think also thanks to thewhacker for gifting the game to me super generous and kind meanwhile the full playlist will be here httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistplyvqudxy6cohxwj98n0qftchjovft8bff you are beeing shadowbanned cant find your videos in my viewing history thought you should know if you dont know what i am talking about look at corbetts video about shadow banning damn i cant watch this before watching all the series first oh gosah if only i had the time wauw the music is loud first time here charismatic youtuber but the way to adress the game is not to my liking feels rather slow still just personal opinion keep up the good work marlins are not originally from a game lol the video and the game are fine enough but that made my day your city building skills make me cry i cant watch think mirror 010430 age of empire ii has the great marlin d the best for fishing they are worth 300 food if i remember correctly the game looks beautiful i wouldve laughed so hard if you had chosen the fleur de lys as your logo after picking the guy who has the almostanironcross on his suit you seem interested enough in history that you may know this even though its knowledge about central europe but in case you didnt the iron cross was a distinctly prussian military decoration and became a german one after prussia formed germany later the nazis appropriated the symbol using it in a similar fashion the fleur de lys being a symbol of the french monarchy was not particularly wellreceived among either prussians or germans at any time where anyone was openly carrying an iron cross on their chest its the 19th or 20thcentury equivalent of a guy wearing the highest us military decoration on his chest leading a business with a giant hammer and sickle as its logo 1600 lol it looks like the newspaper guy has little boy zakh on his lap d so happy you play this this game suits you perfectly i am really happy with how the game turned out i loved this please keep playing nice video big anno fan here your classy outfit really suits the atmosphere of the game as well if i may id very much prefer to see your reaction to whole game that includes cinematics as well honestly this was first time ive seen a streamer disappear like that did someone think about a tale of two cities oh goodness here we go again lol anno 1404 was one of the best game i ever played im very sad i cannot play with this game due to my potato laptop cool outfit btw also love the dissatisfied face when the workers demand sausage d i love watching you play anno i hope you keep on playing 1809 im a real boy ive been watching listening to your video in my side screen while i work lately i always love simulationmanagement games so its really fun to watch someone whos great at it d really love this video the music is fantastic 10040 that random rotation is nice until you want them to be nice and straight then you have to go for other trees that arent turned at random wish we could decide as players hey zack i also just started playing anno 1800 its gorgeous isnt it the play is quite nice here it is ladies and gents i was certainly looking for zakh to record one of the anno games 3 also you look classy af ive watched the opening episodes of a few anno 1800 playthroughs and yours is my favourite so far zakh i tried out the beta last weekend but found the text size too small in some places for the moment i can enjoy your lets play and hope they add a fontui scaling option in a forthcoming update i am super excited to play this love the playthrough cant wait to see more no one is chosing the wahmen anno 1800 is a fantastic game true full fruit of a labor of love thanks for covering it no longer available on steam no dynamite fishing awww fine ill settle for dynamite bird hunting then in my city dynamite fishing will be illegal whooooho o im really excited to see how the game changed since the closed beta in february hooray been waiting for you to play this have already sunk har har about 20 hours into it myself looking forward to seeing some new strategies from you that outfit really suits you d i love your content gamerzakh finally just based on what you have seen so far how would you rate this game from 110 and do you think it is worth the cost at this point well anno in spanish have another meaning xd is it on console is it multiplayer like are you guys playing in a city ss are what the soldiers in the nazi army were called so thats why they wont let you name your ship that probably in the others annos you had to go to other landsislands because of resources in this anno its the same wait so do u not get to choose your own island do something like this again i like it when you play whith others some of the music reminds me of the movie the legend of 1900 and some of sherlock holmes also has anyone ever told you you look like chris pratt i first found you a long time ago and i dont quite remember how but you quickly became one of my favorite youtubers i love city building games is it just naval combat or is there ground troops to use as well how much money did ubisoft pay you yeehaaw two days until full release anno is japanese for ummmm yeah like you are thinking of something to say ummmmmm so i guess they did not know what to call their game british empire intensifies i will tourture the working slave class imagine if 1800 had 2070s faction system like you could have a pseudobritish faction full of industrialists who are good at maxxing out the economy and population and can support a huge navy but have more complicated production chains higher demand for goods and bad ecobalance and then a pseudojapanese faction whose populace will start out completely unindustrialized subsisting on rice and sake but can grow incredibly powerful the more you advance in the population level unlocking new factories that are more efficient and have less upkeep than their pseudobritish counterparts and because the population is not used to industrialized society they will have less ridiculous demands oh oh and maybe we could have a pseudoamerican faction that have amazing energygeneration capabilities good starting tech and great navy but have population growth problems because pseudoamerica is not good at the whole colonization game and maybe financial problems too actuall please dont dumb down the gameplay i am still into anno 1503 will they release a game for every century lame ubisoft is there possible to attack other parties and islands like in anno 1701 i like to destroy other cities i hope they keep the graphics and light effects cant wait to exploit the working class every one is all like cyberpunk death stranding gears battlefield mega mega mega and im just here like those wheat fields pretty much the same trailer as last year so they just remade anno 1404 the last franchise ubisoft has that isnt a complete dumpsterfire more denuvo infested crapware honestly gamers should just take their cash and give it directly to reverse engineers theyll get a higher quality product that can be preserved for the future and better support imagine if instead of giving thousands to ubisoft gamers gave thousands to cpy steampunks voksi baldman et al and they produced functional alternatives reversed multiplayer protocols etc asshole 1800 spanish really looking forward to the dreadnought ships though i do wish there was ground combat how cool would it be to see lines of infantry marching through those field and maybe even early ww1 tanks rolling through the streets i know they are not doing it but man can i dream i really did enjoy dropping troops on enemy islands in 1601ad oh well looking forward to these regardless cant wait hope it will be as good as 1503 hey thats pretty good why you havent play this game skye whyyyy they need more future games you want anno games pre future you have many many to choose from already this looks more like around 18601900 though i expected some late 1700 sailing ships n stuff i want anno modern times who else is gonna be sad until its out hmmnot muchthe 1404 with the game engine of the 2205 i really hope this isnt reskin of 2205 i cant even finish anno 1404 man i was hoping they would at least do freeform roads this time around ive been done with anno series for years still waiting for a revamp of the series props for having the most upbeat outtro music of all the people i sub too on youtube its about damn time is shit nothing new is just a dlc lets see if they get this one right looks the dogs balls cant wait for this one hope its not a fixed map like 2205 and they go back to old style anno looks nice but hope they dont do all that always online stuff put me off buying the last games a developer said it is going to be end 2018 they announced it now because of the anno union additional the game is not even yet in alpha love the older annos 2070 was ok but the newest one sucked hope this 1800 is like the older annos but with modern graphics and multiplayer features d hopefully this is better than the last one i prefer it when they do anno games in the past like this one ancient cities is another one that is promising as well if this is like anno 1404 im sold cool finally another anno cant wait they dont learn not to make a trailer with just cinematics i hope they go back to what made anno so great and dont repeat what they did with the last one its a pity i think both anno and civ could have made great future games if they had implemented them correctly and stuck at it to allow it to develop ugh it looks so good but my pc would rather die than ever run this have you heard they aoe iv was announced by bill gates himself i hope they will add beggars again age of empires 4 and anno 1800 best day of my entire life ehh i personally liked the original view of the future in 2070 and 2205 it just feltfresh 2018 winter as is january february or as in december hell yeah another anno game seems like a nebulous release datewhere i live january is winter but so is december coming q1 or q4 2018 would have been more informative but i am a world building suckeri still play 1602 occasionally this game looks very promising and are you going to do a total war warhammer 2 vortex campaign zero interest in this the last one was just idiotic looks interesting skye are you going to do a series i cant wait for this one i was never really fan of the ones based in the future i still kept playing 1404 maybe when they announce a launch date hou can do a nostalgic trowback to the 1404 games with a short series looks like another disappointment from ubisoft ubisoft we cant think out side the box i was hoping for something back in the romangreekpersian era with carthage too but still it is an anno game and i do love to play them here and there i hope they are not doing square grids for this looks good buddy you going to post play of it everything is great but only complain i have is that its hard to watch your series i mean ep1 is of something and ep2 is completely different and i have to search very hard to find the ep2 which i want to watch otherwise love the work i started watching your ammo 1800s but its too many and i cant find the things in time order can you help me cities

making it a epic store exclusive to scare people into preordering fuck ubisofts corporate greed do they have land units age of ironclad warships in my anno whew was waiting for something like this this game is time machine this looks 2205esque and i am not happy you are destroying the franchise the way ea did with sim city omg i plaied this game for wii what no battle royale dislike anno 1404 venice and anno 2070 are my favorite anno games i think anno 1800 will be great too it will be alot better than 2205 needs 2070s coop please bring coop back i like the design anno 1404 was the best so far i mean the series totally lost me when they did that future shit glad to see they decided to basically go back to the roots gotta say i am hyped which hasnt happen for a long time in terms of games everyone losing their minds freaking out about cyberpunk last of us death stranding gears battlefield qwertyasdfhausdhiaud and im just here like those smokestacks the steel and wheat in this state go through trevor philips industries or they aint going flyyyying the flaaag for us manufacturing the importers need steel and someones gotta give it to em theres iron in them thar hills i juuuust loooove the smell of factory cooking prussobritish empire simulator after napoleonic wars the big protestant nations used there industrial ingenuity and united in to an industrial constitutional monarch superpower now the empire expands from the british isles over northern france down to the lower rhein basin the austrian principalities hungary gained independence galicia and prussia anno the best game series ever where are the trains yes im ready to build a bloody business empire with whore houses the timespan of 1800 is a bit yawn 14001700 is much cooler didnt the other ones suck ass why is it anno 1800 when it takes place in late 1800 i prefer assassins creed syndicate that ubisoft logo made me cringe and instantly think about drm now finally im hyped i was interested by the title just read ubisoft and i wasnt interested all of a sudden ea activision and ubisoft are the cancer of this industry once more it will be a little troublesome for the video requirements sigh my laptop is proper at all except video card sadnessalways something missing i always wonder why overhead strategy games always have these trailers acting like youll get to play in this city i wouldnt have known if it didnt say in description finally some rts just dont make it arcadeish please i hope to god that it isnt as dumbed down as 2205 this wont sell good in spanish speaking countries anno sound the same as spanish for anus nice played the original back the im always amazed by how far this series has come anno means year for those of you who dont know no ones realised that ship is going to plow into that harbour and cause all kinds of damage please please let it be like anno 1404 or 2070 not like that moon garbage dang i cant wait no more love the ending i hope players will be able to build and use those dreadnoughts isnt there already a anno 1800 why is this game called 1800 if the tech is early 1900 i promised myself i will never again allow my self to jump on the hype train again after what happened with no mans sky but im excited about this game i have played every anno series game so far and enjoyed every single one of them well maybe the last one 2205 was a bit worse compared to previous ones but still i did enjoy it this one seems like a return to what we loved about 1404 and 2070 good design choice looks amazing just hope there is non of that mystical religion crap in this one i dont even get hyped any more it going to be the same as anno 2205 single player bullshit with no unique map play wish they would go back to what made anno 2070 great you better lemme fight others in this game so they are reusing themes from 1404 in the soundtrack great the graphics is so 2000 the shadow the lighting and details are all horribly lacking cant wait industrial revolution intensifies when can we preorder it this trailer is poor yeah but anno 200bc when boring game concept imo might have to try this series out 15 console player dislikes please add a multiplayer mode where a 100 players dropped in a small sandbox map and build to the death give us anno 1942 please we want the settlers 8 maps are too small it aint space nor scifi but

destination and then do it in the opposite direction ending in a ohhhhh ive been waiting for this series thank you its disappointing to see you are not continuing the campaign hi what do you mean with fondmail 3421 plz continue this i was awaiting for this video buy items to make your trade ships faster or get better trade prices man i can tell from experience keeping such a clean and nice looking layout in any anno game is a huge pain esp in anno 1404 where you have to build buildings together otherwise they will look ugly but great job on keeping everything here in such a nice and orderly fashion dueling used to be a legitimate legal way to handle a dispute with another gentlemen just imagine that for a second been watching since e1 just now realized we have the same map seed oh no i

clipper wheres ark at i miss the olden days sl1p kevin the clipper donr put your sandmine there its ugly looking been watching since i was 7 and love the videos keep up the great work first i know you made these videos ages ago but when you were trying to add an extra steam shipyard your gun defences were blocking you from placing the shipyard as it needed to go further into the ocean loving the series btw glory to raptoria you need to attack harbors with your ships moving across in front of the harbor to show the broadside and most gun fire your taking a beating doing bow in attacks using less that 14 of your guns per ship the sun will never set on the raptorian empire glory to the raptorian empire glory to raptoria please dont stop doing what you do i love games but cant afford them and so live my gaming life through your videos keep it going mate binges this series over my holidays he had so much money and he only attempted buying ceasefires once he easily could have bought temporary peace to clear the trade routes and attacked later but instead this guy kept wasting resources and shipyard space with clippers that he couldnt even protect smh glory to raptoria raptor big time fan but you kill me with your battle ships turn them to go full broadside you are not using 1 of the 3 guns on your ships cuts their damage by 33 yes it has a rotating turret but it wont shoot through the bridge i got lost again xdd anyway great episodes name the island big bertha for all the ships there who conquered other lands despite taking losses to the big bertha i know this isnt a recent video but i dont get why you didnt take maggie out the first time you fought her shes taken so much from you in sunken trades and like 8 episodes ago you took her down to one maybe 2 active cities and you had plenty of firepower to make it a 3 person match not counting pirates woooow thats epic dude glory to raptoria i do have a question why are you using only 23 of your battlecruisers firepower when they are bow on only their front guns can fire back one is totally useless come on raptor part of the norther sagas something from sweden you said no no my friend love ya but that is all viking history my friend and sweden was never a viking nation you are even naming your ships after nordic gods just screwing with you but i think would enjoy reading the viking sagas glory to raptoria glory to raptoria all hail the king all hail raptorius the great glory to raptoria this game seems cool i might get it if it comes to steam glory to raptoria island name for beauviste the small mineral one silicon valley glory to raptoria glory to the raptorian empire name the island velocitoria at least the likes are up good maybe have a pop up at the start of your videos to push the like button because i think most people just forget to like your videos keep up the amazing effort and enthusiasm you put in your videos i think someone purchased your share thats why your income dropped who da fuck is gloria use those other islands dude might as well spread the empire of raptoria and just dominate half the map by making them self sufficient victory to raptoria glory to raptoria by the way want to know how to change to first person mode thanks victory to raptoria woohohoho why does this sound like shroud is it him playing glory to raptoria if you sell 100 steam engines and 100 advanced weapons you get 13 million in a single trade i think anno should add some airbased units like an airshipblip that could drop tnt or in the advanced weapons could include bombs machine guns could be highly effective to the blimps but canons could not elevate high enough to hit them glory to raptoriaaaaa glory to raptoriaaaaa glory to raptoria victory to raptoria stop selling cannons glory to raptoria victory to raptoria you should make a big birtha gun befriend the pirates so you can trade with them plus use the islands you took has towns so your economy will grow when building the dock the hashed area in front of the blueprint has to be clear mineral iland because dino poop is also called minerals and the iland is a dump name your new island to wolfsburg it was a automotive industry in 1945 glory to raptoria hail raptor all hail raptoria the harbor guns are debuffing you maybe because they have someone equipped at the harbor office to have those debufs you cant put the steamshipyard beacause of guns and totaly blocked it off with the crago thingsi forgot the name hey name the mega ship yamato or iwoa just based of the big battleships of ww2 ctr shift r for first person then press p and your population will follow you you cant place the ship yard because of the defense turret also send supplys to your new islands and produce turrets around the island to keep your trade routes clear they neglect our security our comfort our sons and daughters in the name of this war open your eyes we hear glory to raptoria and we repeat it without thinking the papers are edited and censored to suit the governments desires open your eyes to the truth fellow citizens and demand that no more of our sons sail aimlessly across the map despite being set on passive for this war glory to raptoria glory to raptoria glory 2 raptoria glory to raptoria please name one warship the bser arsch glory to raptoria that land you just took my maggie i think her gun attack and sink many of your trade ship and now you took her land why dont you build some gun over there at that place maybe other enemy cant go through or enemy wont go near by that area i suggest port fortressa for the small island at around 4945 may reptoria rule em all rms victory rlory to gaptoria glory to raptoria i dont play this game so im curious to know are raptors issues with directingcontrolling naval ships a problem with the game itself or is there something hes not doing right to succeed you need to be able to control your navy so it would put me off buying this game if that was a problem with the game itself any answers riot goal to parry to build your second steam ship harbor you have to move those two guns that are in the water itself glory to raptoria just build steam transports and they wont be destroyed as easily and theyre faster glory to raptory you also might want to think about putting a gun on that island you took from maggie that was killing all your ships it has good range and could help hit ships that are chasing your boats glory to raptoria pretty sure your ship harbor wont fit because your guns are in the way if you can move them out further or to the side of one of the shorter ones i think you can add it take over warmonger maggies old island for resources glory to raptoria glory to raptoria you should think about turning one of the island into a farming island that has mills bakers slaughter houses clothes markers animals farms on it maybe maggies old one its big enough to hold all of it and has multiple shores to build harbors to ship the goods from you could rename beauviste to lice island which stands for limestone iron coppers exports glory to raptoria gunsat least it will give you time to get your ships to help in area more defense on islands you just tookkeep from the others attacking them you cant place shipyard because your defence cannons are in the way need one ship named asgardand move guns in front of dock to build more guns around the islands glory to raptoria name on new islands mongoville let all hope go widow island glory to raptoria glory to raptoria i watch both anno 1800 series and love them love the series but i have a couple of questions arent those battleships supposed to fire from broadside because i only see 2 out of the 4 guns firing every siege and isnt it a good idea to make your fleet a bit diverse so you have ships that are more capable of laying down fire onto the buildings raptor you cant fit the 3rd steam dock because the harbor guns are in the deployment zone are you ever gonna use a big betty to build more of the steam ship yard you need to remove the big canons in front of it glory to raptoria glory to raptoria glory to raptoria glory to raptoria answer to you comments raptor first of all im not a youtuber to start with and i have no interest in been one im a mechanical engineering student seconde that was an advice not a insult and i was just pointing the obvious for everyone except you that people dont like watching casual player in youtube except if you are really funny they go to watche the pro and the at least the really good go back and watche your own video and you will the see the amount of mistakes you make third the last can be verified go and see top gaming video and you will see that the the video lengths vary from 10 to 30 min and again i dont want to insult you just to help you out try it for one video like the next one makes it 30min long by cutting the boring part and try harde all the game and see if view dont go up actually just making the video 30 by cutting and not by playing only 30min will boost the views and ty for the replay glory to raptoria glory to raptoria can you try and trade with the pirates nice done remind me to never play cards with you glory to raptoria press f to pay respects for the original fleet glory to raptoria no bendy roads great vid as an operations advisor this was so sexy to watch lol just subbed thanks for the great video started playing yesterday failed w couple of times and you ended up building how i was day dreaming st work i should keep it up you probably dont need me to tell you you made a mistake with the lumberjacks and sawmills you want them next to each other so the lumberjack is supplying the sawmill directly and it doesnt have far to go otherwise the lumberjack sends them off to the warehouse because its no longer 1to1 its all about efficiency with this game otherwise what happens is in your case is that the lumberjacks will send the logs to the warehouse first and then the sawmills have to go and collect it another thing that is important is to check out how many farmers or workers it takes to run a business if you dont have enough of one or the other what happens is that the workers will spread out across all of the work buildings and you will never have enough workers farmers in turn that makes it very inefficient and you will readily loose money due to the lack of workforce because barely anything is being madeso always check each business and how many employees it needs by doing this each bu how did you select multiple buildings with your cursor i only know to use the shortcuts for buildings but i couldnt figure out how you drag your mouse with a green highlight on it are your youtube viewers considered content farmers thanks for the uploads just started playing anno 1800 huge noob when it comes to city building games your video is helping me out just bought the game because of this why do you worry about how things are laid out too much time wasted on how to set things up not everything is square good game though thinking of getting it i have this game as well but i found it is more entertain to see you play it what i like about partyelites commentary is he thinks out aloud he tells us how he is working things out and how he implements this into the game i think that is very helpful one thing i would do as soon as the opportunity presents itself is build a shipyard or even purchase a couple of ships so i can start trading it would be a useful source of additional income and in this session partyelite would be able to continue maximum wood production and export it it is an 1800s corporate war im actually quite pleased with this campaignstoryline its interesting this is by far the best anno out of the whole franchise finally a time when there was no blm movement keep the campaign going wow i love the soundtrack wonder if itll be on spotify why did you make 4 wood cutters so close together none of them are working correctly im super bad at managing my buildings in games like this so this is a huuuuge help for me keep them coming you can import the steel at you harbor your charcoal production can go next to your lumberjack productionlike your lay outuse crop farms at the wonky edges to create clean edges elsewhere that introshot legit made me sick might had been the depth of field or motion blur great gamebut wasted on a petty exclusive bulshittery and yes i hate exclusives on my day job ive been following you for a while and seeing your recent channel growth i was wondering if your recent growth was due to you going pro seems like an opportunity you could pursue if you wanted to definitely one of my top lets play channels every time youre interrupted i chuckle keep the dialog thanks for this video man was enjoyable and when you lost your flagship i internally screamed damn pirates got me too lol im really enjoying how you plot out everything and set up your farms and industry buildings i watch keralis videos too and its nice to see different approaches to layouts looking forward to seeing how your campaign game plays out can we just take a moment to talk about how good the music is in this game something about that piano and string combo great video man i would love to see more of this great game i really enjoy your commentary and building style talk over the voices if not important actually a funny thing about dynamite fishing or explosions in the water in general unless its a very high end incendiary dynamite is not then the heat is very quickly absorbed by the water its the pressure that does it the blast wave transfers even harder under water and thats what kills the fish its like hitting every part of it with a hammer all at once the fish wouldnt be charred but they would have a lot of broken bones making slicing them up a bit more of a chore pronounced bo sen loved the video however one thing is driving me mad the explanations are super useful and informative however is it possible for you to keep an eye on your income and if its negative pause the game sometimes you were giving some beautifully detailed talks but losing money at the same time and im screaming at the screen its not so bad if you are making money and you dont want to be too stop start but no one wants to see you go bust because you were explaining the intricacies of anno pig farming keep it up i liked the game seeing you play it i wish that you make it a daily series you need wiener to make people live in your house feelsweirdman keep it going for a long while ive not seen this franchise before so its a surprise to see it and want it now d play the campaign in full so this isnt fully simulated like cities skylines oh no poor thunderclap play this game pls the music is very immersive the mouth movements suck man anno for me is unplayable quests are bugged cant complete and the game just constantly crashes but its nice to see your game is working shoulda chose the chineese chick very unique potential chineese in 1800s more houses is not wasteful you get more taxes how am i not surprised you lose your flagship so early on name the ship seafang this will be my 2nd anno game ever what i reallyreally want to have next to anno 1404 venice so keep going good tips are always nice to haveget p i love the anno series but the sorry state of ubisoft servers and pseudodrm prevents me from playing anything after 1404 update servers offline should be branded on their ceos ass i might drop in to check out the gameplay and to slowly convince myself to buy it on sale one day dont know how things are in this particular anno but normally not everything needs to be connected to everything so for example i suggest leaving the clay production separated from everything else so that you can make sure nobody from your farms take the long way to the claywarehouse for the ships name i suggest something like hms paperboy since you got it from the newspaper dude as always great video about one of my favorite game series of all time keep it up is this a british colonialism simulator flagship name boaty mcboatface so the dogs were ruffly in that area damn i really love it d you making it so easy to understand d so i hope it will come out everyday d or 2 everyday because am thinking of buying it but i want to see more and learn more first d so keep up the good work d possible names for ship could be enterprise curiosity or voyager maybe old but still sounds good happy to see anno getting proper series is there seriously no way to adjust the amount of yapping this game does there really should be an option for such a thing either similar to total war warhammer where you have several levels of advice or a toggle for critical information only at the least your uncle was taunting you for giving in to his demands with the black sheep rhyme also uncle edvard sounds like he was voiced by tim curry to me at least great video i like the water i really like the water the water great stuff dude keep em coming atleast two hour per day as a student of logistics and supply chain management this pleases me love it been watching your warhammer and battlefleet armada guess ive found the next section to watch preordered the game my first anno game lets see how it goes looking great tho also u have way too less views idk y i like ur content keep going looking forwards to more of this lets play and the campaign mode is really tempting me to buy it myself i played anno 2070 but soon got bored looks like theres a lot more narrative meat in this one on can food island next to all the cannery how about building a long park by removing the middle street or placing a fountain at both end of the middle street love how you are dividing the work among the islands american idol thought you dont sing lol put workers houses out by the places they work so they dont have to walk so far fyi any boat longer than 50 feet is called a ship other than a barge hi pls do ark again like if agree amazingness as always my hat is off to you sir keep on keeping on ma man 3 i love how much you love the game dude i love this make more stuff and things looking forward to the construction of an epicallyimpenetrableharbouredfortressofdoomisland island there is a thing in the harbor section i believe a comuter pier that alows workforce to travel from island to island maybe its the next tier up thoughbut in the future it should be possible to have the higher society only on the main island and let them travel the one dislike is anne harlow you planted a tree in the spot where there should be a road at your cannery slip youve blocked a road with a tree at the caned food production so it is confirmed that u live at tampa and first may memory restore again and again the smallest color of the smallest day time is the school in which we learn time is the fire in which we burn delmore schwartz and our cities seem to catch fire often lol i dont know why but after settling a new island and it plays that little music i say refreshing its literally the sound we should hear after washing using irish spring soap i can play up to anno 1701 but not beyond but thats okay my computer is old but loyal sir i live in your city and you havent produced beer yet there is a noble heart in there hippie rioters better build a nice park that square you designed is god awful youre great with all the micromanagement though lol is there going to be an anno 1800 game on xbox can someone please confirm as because i cant afford to by a new pc so this is basically a what communism shouldve been like simulator state owned everything damn and bunch of equality too wow thank you for this miniseries its interesting to notice changes after open beta has ended 1 the obnoxious loud music in expeditions is gone replaced with beautiful music just awesome 2 isabela gives island a starter pack when the new world is discovered so theres no need to send another ship with planks steel and bricks 3 bridges now require wood 4 ai is smarter and more aggressive so letters of immunity will be of great use especially when the ship carries expensive personnel or cargo that would hurt to lose activating this letter will allow to run from pirates i hope at least 5 the reroll of items that traders offer costs a lot more now so trade charters might also be used to cut prices and buy expensive people from prison for less cant wait for the final game to roll out in less than 12 hours played the open beta and my profit just kept dropping to the negatives any tips on how to get it up for release day for upgrading you can click on the upgrade building icon in the bar next to the demolish icon and just drag it to what you want to upgrade instead of one by one works with upgrading the houses too love the series so far leave the names till the game man now the beta is ended sad gotta wait for my cd key sponsor video good for you but this game kind of boring frost punk is better why is there a priest in prison in the first place oh what did he say end omg no way dont plzzzz noooo keep up the videos im enjoying this edit oh i forgot its a limited beta lol i will need to wait it comes out lol im so hyped you can use the upgrade tool to build blueprints no it is the end it was fun while it lasted raptor has anyone figured out how to change the price of selling your goodsproduce 10 likes so far lets do this comonnnnn there is a noble heart in you somewhere remember to tumb up 2 episodes of anno in 1 day settle islands faster first what a machine oh look tons of dislikes peasants got triggered by smthng i wonder what that was probably gonna like it so the battle is only by the ocean is it multiplayer with ai or with other people store seems to suggest ai only insane player but an annoying person lmao nice gameplay but dude whats with the high school level humor the constant cussing is a bit off putting not necessary imo nice gameplay but please stop talking it just sounds annoying stfu you are so annoying please do more anno 1800 you are the only anno 1800 player i enjoy watchingothers play like

audiomerge it with a voice over where you comment some shit thats like no effort if you really wonna play this game on hardmore select small islands besides income this is the only option that really makes this game difficult every other settings can be disregarded ive been much more of a build pretty cities type of person when it came to previous anno releases but damn this looks so interesting i might wanna get into pvp too difficulty level asian this guy has some issues youre awkward and weird but boy do you know how to play this game u should make some guides youre crazy wow a 5 minute

like an absolutely great and indepth game lionheart do remember to empty the cargo hold of the ship when you are about to pick up proof in the water you will need the guns but since you are not going

satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory get anno 1800 34 off uk europe only httpswwwcdkeyscompcgamesanno1800pcuplaycdkeymwarefrepublic weve had over 1200 people buy gamesdlc from cdkeys and ive done as much background checks on them as i can from both inside a aaa company and outside they check out so im happy to support them ive been playing this game since beta and from a one year old video ive just learnt that you can move items between ships on sea by drag and drop duh d as a german anno fan i can only saythere are manny city builder games outside and but only one annotry it and you will love iti sink now 1300 houers and still not booring too bad i cant get it on steam the place where i prefer to catalog my games big fat ubisoft nope theres 2 kind of games outthe citybuilder and annoif you try anno you will allways anno always love anno since its first game anno 1602 brilliant video how do you buy this game got it at the top wish there was more military mechanics like a modern command and conquer with more city building i really enjoyed anno 2205 and 2075 cool video anno 1701 is the best in my opinion the problem with unlimited ressources became clear in anno 2070 you could just keep digging deeper for ressources big part of the fun is colonizing to get the ressources there should be a gamemode where most ressources would be very limited and fertility drops with pollution this would make the game more fast paced and strategic and it would be a reason for conflict now as you said also in prvious titles the ai are kind of passive nothing i loved more in anno 1701 with custom maps where i would make all iron reserves limited making it the most valuable resource and making everyone go apeshit devastating every last island on the map wait so in this game you dont start with peasants does the title of the game mean that you start the game from 1800 if only you could make curved roads epic games exlcusive the game is already dead people dont move between work and home they live where they work in those days people used to have residential units in their industrial buildings thats where they live i have been waiting for 2 years for this game now finally i preordered the deluxe edition and cant wait to start playing you can bet the artic and desert biomes are going to be dlc locked desert bione for a arabic countries dlc and a artic dlc for science research this is a very well done review if theyre happy theyll pay their taxes irs haha it dont work that way fam ok its on steam for 60 euros i cant really afford that kind of money so i think im gonna lay low and wait for a sale or until price drops a bit and remember lets get this bread lets obtain this grain lets feast on this yeast lets yeet this wheat nice thanks for the review looking forward to get this as well huge fan of the series looks like an intersting game will pick it up from epicthanks for the video it was well done cant wait for this game if you want it on steam make sure you buy it by 41619 or youll have to buy it from the game store that the publishers sold out to ubisoft lost my support i own several of their products all bought thru steam no more money from me then ubisoft i will recommend this to my entire friends list and any platform i belong too will hear this message gaming is a multibillion industry let your voice be heard and say no steamsad yeah but sadly they are going semiexclusive on epic fuck epic i hope youre right ive just preordered it on steam to avoid the move to epic anno 1800 will only be available digitally on the ubisoft store and the epic games store ubisoft has announced that future ubisoft titles will be moving to epic games store ubisoft will longer put their future titles onto steam its going to epic store guess i wont be buying ahh shit a new one i havent finished my single scenario in anno 1404 to have a look what the game looks like before i start the campaignyou have just played 122hrs in one go i think you really should take a break as a little boy i played anno 1602 the first one ever produced and all the following except 2205 what i thought wasnt my personal fav style of anno man anno 1602 turned me into the citybuildingmanaging fan i am today so looking forward to 1800 and im happy to hear that you found your way into this marvelous series hf thank god no more future city building games i think ubisoft finally listened last to annos were garbage this looks amazing i am about to preorder how does the game run any slow down with big cities and having multiple city simulation running in the background wow im sure ill have tons of fun playing this in four years when its finally 20 this game looks like a premise id be very interested in experiencing thanks for uploading this as it wasnt really on my radar either too bad its so close to the release of imperator perhaps ill look into one of their early games as well do you play city skylines you mentioned it a couple time and i bought it on sale but have yet to play it though if you do id really enjoy viewing any content you put out on it new to the channel found you because of the dev blogs u analysed on the game i mentioned earlier i also am a tw fan so glad i discovered your channelman youve come a long way from some of your earlier videos keep up the good work great review good job if you do decide to play one of the older anno games my suggestion is 1404 or dawn of discovery ive played all of them until 2205 the only advantage i saw in the later games was being able to put down entire blocks of houses at once i want it is there a way to change the perspective this view from the side is just retarded great review thx 1404 dawn of discovery is one of my fave all time games this looks like an updated version which is perfect i think arctic biome would be boring since in early ages i think its mostly for things like crab fishing ice trading whaling and nabbing exotic animals to sell so basically no building outside of ports and housing i just dont see how this would be fun unless you just traded with npc arctic posts ground combat realy leaves a big hole in this game 1404 still is the best you should get anno 2070 as well i know many people promote anno 1404 and i agree it was really good 1404 was my first anno game but in all honesty anno 2070 is my favorite at least it is if you have all the dlcs for it the deep ocean expansion in particular is critical to enjoying 2070 to its fullest i especially loved the research aspect and the way they integrated it into the game definitely worth a play you can skip anno 2205 though it wasnt a terrible game but it wasnt a good game either it had some interesting and even some fun elements but some things were just overly dumbed down over simplified and it had too much reliance on forcing you to play a repetitive and boring mini game just to progress and the repeated attempts to integrate into a terrible ios and android game with microtransactions and time gates was just plain insulting if you want to know the full truth on that one in the end it was a beautiful game it was even a decent is ubisoft gonna fuck it with their pathetic always online bullshit is 1404 any good i have that in my steam library but havent played it yet i came into the series with 2070 i can see why people liked 1440 better but there were things 2070 tried that worked and some that didnt however the stuff 2070 did more interestingly made me love it more than 1440 then the next game came out and doubled down on the lack of focus issues 2070 had without fixing any of its problems resulting in a pretty trash game this new one excites me however every anno game has a certain year in its title and when you add up all the numbers its always 9 1404 or 1800 9 mindfuck mindfuck fantastic review really got me hyped up for this game and made me feel like the preorder was worth it for once lol anno 1701 and its dlc sunken dragon is by far one of my most favorite games of all times but this one looks like itll top even that for me cant wait thanks for the video my man 717 so warehouses require extra unloading bays to get the goods in but ships can just sail directly through one another so realism much convincing soo banished on drugs the problem ive had with the series is that it feels exactly the same with each new age okay ive built this thing that unlocks this okay but i need these resources now okay got it now it unlocks this building which needs these new resources etc etc it looks awesome didnt knew this game was coming till i saw it here definitely will be on my wishlist now thanks will buy 1010 mate you need to play anno 1404 its still great only on uplay no thanks youve turned me around ive played the originals and got put off with their scifi jaunt and how simplistic some things were but it seems the mechanics have evolved somewhat and so have the graphics itd be good to return to the anno series there is no daynight cycle so lucky i want to play this game so bad im so happy to hear you enjoy it im a huge fan of the anno series wasnt a big fan of the scifi ones but this is refreshing to hear its good thanks for the review it looks cool i am playing anno 2205 and liking it a lot although 2205 is the future i can see a lot of similer mechanics in the new 1800 game the one thing about anno games is they have a ton of gameplay is it going to make you login online to play never played perivious anno games but im looking forward to anno 1800 this will be fun i used to love these kinds of games but they require a lot of in terms of learning curve and lofe gets in the way ive settled for simpler albeit less rewarding games like fps and action adventure type waiting for the loot boxes and micro transactions to come out after release d i want to play it omg already release it waiting too long anno 1800 looks great will get it as soon as i finish frostpunk im not gonna watch a 14 min ad youre even reading their script wtf new world americas was pretty much divided up asia not so much yet just go in and display the superior range of western cannons and export opium to get business running then there is the 1870s onward scramble for africa if going by history a bit weird one would start on a tiny island tho that applies to no nation of the time unless its some lolland governot haveing a go at munipal level imperialsim lol nice gameplay review well done one of those beautiful resource and supply chain management games from my childhood that im so happy to see return to full form i spent hours and hours between anno civ empire earth and caesar 1404 is best up to this day as older ones looks bitold so its an 1800s version of the 20th century game called simm city this is the only game i have really been looking forward to for a long time cant wait for release is there a way to preorder this review sounds like a paid advertisement very impressive with the review and how this was explained i have been watching the anno 1800 review items and quite interested in it what youve mentioned above has me quite interested in wanting more and this is something which i think i may make a purchase awesome review i might be wrong but isnt this just a reskin of tropico the things you mention seem to be very similar to that game never played any anno titles before dam i rememebr anno dominus or wahtever that game was fun back in the day fuck uplay still square road networks though seems like a reskin mostly hello there hearing you havent tried the earlier anno games i would recommend you have a look at anno 2170 without giving a review of the game i would like to point out the existence of the anno 2170 arrc mod with my personal number 1 reason for using it larger maps here is a link to any that should be interested httpanno2170arrcdeindexphppageinfo you also need a 1800 pc anno 2205 is a really good game its just ahead of its time and species the game look perfect my experience with city building strategie games is with settlers 2 on amiga and civ iii on windows 98 seeing how pretty this is im absolutely amazed im hoping to either get this or the new settlers if it turns out good same thing as 1404 flashbacki wont buy it there should be travel time between the continents and messages about events from the other continent should be communicated using telegraph i think this can add a whole nice of gameplay element that looks good darren ty for sharing i did play a very old anno tile some years back 1404 i think it was which i enjoyed but this looks way better i loved the beta it ran rather well for my aging machine looked well played like an anno should with a few new things and i like the oldnew world bit though i hate the influence system also because i always go big and that doesnt work with influence as well it doesnt scale along with it correctly so i find it too limiting i do like the charter system really cuts down on the hassle for transporting goods but you still have to set it up but now instead of havig ot build your own ships you kind of just hire others to do it for you the newspaper is nice but the influence cost is way too high i suggest they change that into a gold cost that is just calculated to how much youre making and get a percentage cost and or a minimum i dont understand the excitement for this game its essentially a 60 dollar graphical upgrade in the last gamesstill only square roads wtf i was hoping for more customization sadly i will not buy this one i loved 1602 ad as a kid very cozy game i still go back and play it every few years introduced me to classical music too 2 minutes in and im sold i would definitely buy the game if it isnt still using a squaregrid building placement system 1404 and 2070 are the best so far 2205 was ok but not that great graphics look pretty disappointing dont tell me its a beta will be better as a final product etc seriously compared to 1404 and hardware then and now not good at all not at all 1404 looks more realistic it was mind blowing for that time and that games is 10 years old 10 years i mean compare the tree water hay textures moving animations on anno 1404 and this one just terrible its literally a clone i only played anno 1602 was realy good i only played anno 1602 was realy good not going to play this because it just celebrates western white male dominance colonial era disregard for anything outside the scope of the usual amazing how little changed and still selled as a new game totally disagree yep i think anno might just be back babby playing since 1602 btw 1503 was my favorite until now i got a save bug in the beta after about 8 hours and couldnt continue on playing but i loved it i think im gonna go and buy it when it comes out first i was heard of anno series it was just before the 2070 release it was looking good but it went mixed rating then anno 2205 was coming and i was waiting again it went mixed ratings now anno 1800 is coming and by looking into past games im expecting this will get mixed ratings too these are expensive games so mixed ratings means you have at least 50 chance to get rippedoff by the company it must have very positive ratings otherwise i dont have money for gambling untill i get rich so i can burn my money into mixed rating games tropico 6 should worrys lol inappropriate language filter in a fucking single player campaign what the happier the ppl are the more tax they pay are they stupid or what they prob produce more shit and in term increased the amount of tax they pay wtf is that at the top of the screen at 1245 and 1248 groaningen and zwollen names of dutch cities but in a way theyve never been spelled the anno franchise has always excelled at the tiny details and solid smooth gameplay ever since i stumbled across 1404dawn of discovery ive wondered how the franchise is so niche instead of being more popular than simcity cool review rop hello republicofplay just recently subscribed after i watched like 23 videos of you playing looking forward to more anno1800 when possible what a dislike about annoseries is the mixed gameplay of buildingmanagement which is great and combat which is terrible is it true that it is always online anno 1404 was the best before and it was my fav from the anno series but i think anno 1800 will surpass it i was able to play it for a day but it was worth it definitely gonna get 1800 in april this fat guy playing cupid is getting on my nerves what the fuck they wont let you name your character something inappropriate on a single player mode thats a no buy from me i played the beta and my review is 610 for me anno 1404 was the best in the series i really really hope 1800 lives up to it some of that economic game play takes me right back to caesar iii and pharaoh never play the old anno my god shame on you shame is it possible to play a gme without ai rivals i really love this kind of games but im not very good at them my organization and planification skills are terrible in real life too xd and sometimes i just want to relax and see my cityempire grow without the pressure of competition have never played anno before and you choose to play with less guidance and normal which is pretty hard for newcomers difficulty i salute you sir d can you suppress the riot is there a police force looks fun maybe a reskin of 2070 with some upgrades big anno fanor in the least the traditional anno fan never liked the look of the sci fi or the modern look anno this has been one of my most anticipated games since i heard of its reveal the graphics on it looks gorgeous not for this price i can wait for discount im a fan of 1404 venice its great and by the looks of it 1800 will be by far the best of the series does look like a massive upgrade to age of empires 3 to me anno 2070 was great dumb haters so how much did you get paid for this review aint no shame in getting paid for reviews but its proper form to disclose it profanity filter in single player nothing wrong with hans von schlong tropico wanabe the last and only time i played anno was that nintendo ds game i might buy this tho this looks good ill pick this up in a heartbeat this looks amazing in every conceivable way anno 2205 had a similar thing going on with different maps running simultaneously which confused me more than anything but it looks much more interesting in this one no land army not sure about multiple new worlds theres only one new world for every game i think so we only have two sessions per game one old world and one new world right so its anno 1602 with better graphics this should probably have a sponsored tag this looks like a must buy but its ubisoft so i will need to see how its like when its fully released so far so good i say and thanks for a lot of close up shots im bitter that i wasnt invited to the beta shills are cheap these days a free copy of the game and they suck your balls just try to acquire the golden ship in 1404 it is doable but it will take you a couple of hundred hours probably to actually get it certain achievements really require you to have indepth knowledge of the game ie building the mosque in less than 5 hours or the dome in 7 hours speeding up the game will reduce the time you have in reallife to build these buildings while slowing it down will grant you more rlhours d while other just require you to grind certain missions over and over again which is a bit tedious after a while sorry but if you havent played the previous anno games it doesnt matter to me how you feel about this one i dont mean that in a bad way or anything not meant as insult but 1404 and 2070 were incredible games and the mos recent was was so bad in comparison because it went away from the formula im worried they will do that again so basicly this is anno 1404 extended sounds like anno 2205 but i prefer the futuristic settting id suggest you play anno 2070 at the moment it is the best in the series and you can see where the series is coming from i played the beta too and i thought it is a good step in the right direction but i would still like to see some things more fleshed out in all the anno games the sum of the number in the title is always 9 180018009 do you hear the people sing lol tropico 6 is going to feel like a mobile game compared to this shame there is no land units im not gonna lie the riot was hilarious oppressed workers rise up im sad that this one is set in the past but it looks decent those fish pies smell gert lush haunts my dreams hearing it again in this video has triggered my brain the pies haunt me cheers ill never understand why people hate so much on anno 2205 i played 1404 2070 and i think 2205 is great all it does is streamlining some things that had to be done manually in the previous games but its got an amazing setting and the maps themselves are very well crafted it certainly does not have the same replay value from the other ones but in my opinion its actually the better anno game if you intend to play a single but deep playthrough combat in it is bad but its always been bad and im actually glad anno 2205 took a step into separating the general gameplay from it i got the chance to play it during the technical test ubisoft did a few month ago please tell me that anno 1800 isntanno 2207 in a different age otherwise this game isnt even worth 10 minutes of my time lets all hope that anno 1800 is the next great anno game and not anno 2200 ish i found the anno series to be pretty good but once you found a good town recipe it became a grind out the levels though wondering if this will be any different one of the first video games i ever played was anno 1602 creation of a new world from 1998 and i loved it the settlement management the progression the logistics the exploration and naval battles even back then were great everything felt in place ive played all of them up to the futuristic ones as i wanted to avoid disappointment but thats what a true sequels should look like in games build on top of the good things in the old ones like mechanics gameplay update the graphics add some new cool feature thats fleshed out and voala you got yourself another successful game nowadays we too often see ambitious projects seeking the hype shock and awe that are rushed out and end up changing way too many things basically making 3 steps forward but 5 steps backwards im still playing anno 1602 my self and still like it got 1404 to collectors edition pre ordered after i played the beta i already loved the old anno games and this one is giving me a good feeling while playing one of the good reviews of this game thank you sir revolution nice omg i think its spreading thats not good every british empire ever d blue byte released a very nice game in 1992 which seems similar the settlers d looks awesome only thing i dont like is the grid system straight roads etc look a bit silly and unrealistic dont they all play the same never really liked the first one which was just super tedious ocd efficiency layout of ploppables anno 1800 is excellent paid youtuber werent trade companies declining at this time a lot of trade companies already ended at this point and getting replaced by actual regional governments nice gameplay and thanks for the info considering this game is based during the time of the industrial revolution are there political options or factions in the game like the rich vs the working class capitalism vs socialism can you change your economic system like this kinda like tropico i loved it too i just hope they fix some major problems and add more much more decorations for parks beauty builder here looks beautiful and epic have to try it we need that kind of system in total war games can you move the camera and give orders while paused youre not really discovering continents now are you i played it in beta as well and i have to say the game itself really is amazing however uplay multiplayer is terrible i played with my brothers and we couldnt play longer than 3 hours before we encountered desyncs every 30 seconds yes you can resync the game but what is it good for if the desync happens again after someone presses a button world map for example also it seems that it was not able to save a game on your own only autosaves its the same shitty uplay connection as always it seemed even worse considering it got worse and worse the longer we played i really hope they fix the desync stuff until release because the game itself is by far the best anno ever tropico 6 is coming out bad should fight for it spot this game is probably the most polished aaa game launched in the last 23 years anno 1800 looks more like managing a 21st century theme park i dont think artic and desertic bioms are going to be dlcs because these are where you can find luxury ressources such as whales oil for lamps and spices which are needed for the next population tiers at least it was in anno 1602 anno 1503 great video its just so expensive and it comes out at the same time as imperator the biggest problem with this series is the broken ai unfortunately otherwise what you showed is basically every other anno game out there with very few changes you should also give 2070 a play through it suffers from its connection to uplay but its a thoroughly enjoyable game if you can get passed that it splits everything up between two major and one minor faction the ecos tycoons and techs personally its how i was introduced to the anno series and i am greatly looking forward to 1800 bit disappointed that the release date got pushed back but i am all for it if it makes for a more polished and well recieved game pushed back to april 16 why are so many city builder games just capitalism simulators i want a game where you can build a just classless socialist society its also about 4 grand to buy looks like this might finally scratch my settlers itch ive had for a while okay im going to say it so just calm down i liked anno2205still do that said i can understand why lots of annonites would want to see the game get back to its rootsjust sayin only thing it lacks for an instant buy was not using uplay as a luncher it really sucks and makes all their games worse ive played all of the annos and this one has me excited the last one felt like a cash grab anno and i didnt like it but this feels like an old style anno but with more options and greater graphics uggh they pushed it 2 months i just want to play already wait you mean if im not happy i can choose not to pay my taxes they all have their charms ive loved them all i played 1404 when it first came out and was hooked on the series since i love scifi so the later ones really take the cake for me though so bummed to hear that the game has been pushed back to april im torn between my love of the anno series and my hatred for ubisoft so to compromise ill wait for it to be on a sale thanks for bringing this game to my attention anno 2070 deep sea was the best underwater building sadly i really miss ground units how do you sound so much younger what black magic sorcery is this its basically the game zeus but with better graphics i like it any of you notice that dude shook his head slightly when schlong was typed 114 as a veteran i dont like the menu the npcs the blurry engine the building sounds i pretty much like the rest unsure if i will buy it and just work my way into it it serms to be a good and complex game again im glad you found your way to anno i always liked the historical titles most and i hope that this title brings back the good old annofeeling you should install the anno 1404 community patch it fixes a lot of things and adds a lot of quality of life stuff please use more appropriate language lol everyone is complaining about ubisoft yet they seem to move into the right direction again when comparing them to other big publishers of course i hope division 2 also gets the love it needs wish you had discount deals at a global store i am canadian and my currency isnt as strong as the sterling pound great review really enjoyed the pace of the video and you could tell you put the time and effort into the game and enjoyed it as a big fan of 1404 differently give it a go as it still holds up in my opinion and is one of the best in the series i had a lot of fun during the beta weekend and looking forward to 1800 launching in a few weeks great video love the way you patiently explain each thing subbed what happened to your dei campaign with jackie fish never played the anno games but am somewhat curious about them as a fan of the tropico and sim city games showing my age tropico 1 is my favourite would i enjoy this when are you doing another empire divided video hey first time seeing one of your reviews but this was a really nice video great content with no annoying intro or music this looks really good anno 1404 is excellent i hope you make a series on it been following these in videos of beta it looks amazing in all regardsyou forgot to mention the amazing blueprint mode looks fantastic one very picky criticism for anno games is that you never see buildings being constructed its just click and drop i always think it adds to the immersion when that feature is in these type of games those are really tall humans or small buildings a review over view i actually needed thanks very good video keep up the good work and the streams wait theres a new anno ho wasnt this one the first that isnt a ubi game if so i may take it never played an anno game before but this time period interested me this review really solidfied my hype thanks ive never played anno but some mechanics remind me of patrician 3 in patrician you dont build the city you are just the head of a company like anni you are responsable of building houses to your workers keeping you ships in good condition building crops and workplaces hops and breweries but you have to get permission of the municipality to build in the city fufill missions buy things where they are cheap and sell them where they are expansive for example rostock produce furs so they sell cheap while london needs furs so they buy in high price if you have never tried maybe it is worth testing well i guess ill be getting my first anno series game then it looks amazing thanks for the great video showing it off that transition sound between maps sounds like a bug flying by my ears and i dont like it i didnt have a big interst in the game mods force him to play the game i still wish for land forces troop count doesnt have to be large but the revolution thing just really made me wonder it would be cool if you could have colonial militias and armed revolutions and if the rebels take over a settlement they turn pirate or you could violently end the rebellion p in anycase im really impressed with how this looks and ill be definitely keeping an eye on it i would love to buy this but since it is published by ubisoft ill skip those nakkers aint getting my money after what they did to my boy assassins creed darren are you going to make the macedon vs india dei videos to end the series would have bought it but imperator rome is being released in april too and as a big fan of the paradox grand strategy games and only a small fan of anno 1404 i wont be buying this for now as someone who has played anno since the first edition i would say it is definetly worth buying this one nothing beats 1404 but this is a very good part of the series netherlands simulator 2019 man you missed some awesome games if you never played anno before long time anno fan happy to see they return to the old format this is looking great looks like a different sort of aoe 3 thats just what i thought of when i first saw it how is the micromanagement are you required to have multiple cities on multiple islands like the previous anno game or can you have one giant city on one island basically they realized anno 1440 is the apex and did a nice job wow never played anything in the anno series this looks great you did a great job with the review thanks for your efforts a multiplayer campaign sounds awesome maybe the next one with jackie and maybe someone else as well im really sad that i cant get anno 1404 because it seems region locked to europe i searched for that game for ages after i had watched vids of it nearly a decade back and i only find out i cant get it on the bright side i will be able to get anno 1800 despite it being like 50 bucks why there is no oriental faction it was the best and all the spices lovely music playing during the riot game looks great cant wait to get it thanks for the sneak peek darren hope this is the return of your fantastic reviews etc more power to the rop i was not considering anno 1800 but based on this vid i now am anno 1100 would be more my thing thanks for you insights darren never played any of these myself either but this one looks pretty interesting and a nice game to look at im usually not into strategy games anymore for the most part due to the total war battles paradox features syndrome these days but i might give this one a go great coverage alo beautiful game cant believe how good looking this game looks i never had the chance to get into anno games before but i am considering this one to be my friend probably will buy it game looks good amazing and perfect but ubisoft in the german community not only strategy games are comparatively popular but anno 1800 and the settlers series both make almost all their money in german sales numbers which i dont understand theyre both such great series if you want to try them out look for anno1404 and the settlers 3 thanks for the vid damn this game looks really cool thanks for talking about it i tried nearly every anno there is but im also especially excited for 1800 i enjoyed the beta very much and i couldnt think of a better overview over the beta than you did darren great job the only issue i had with the game was peformance since the game got a bit laggy in the late stages of a game i had 20k pop over 7 islands but im confident blue byte will adress this issue since they pushed the game back to april and their games usually run very smoothly in 2205 you could have 4 seasons on different continents and it still would run super smoothly again great betareview based off of this video and legends video this has become a day 1 purchase for me great job aahahah oh god you get a like just for that name von schlong d we know how anno works show us the game naval battles in this game are simplistic yet enjoyable i wish total war at least had something like that im happy youve finally played anno d the ai stuff is probably going to change a bit in the finished game ive played the beta quite a bit and the ai is much more passive including the pirates than anno 1404 the theme in 1800 is close to perfect and it suits the gameplay much more than the futuristic setting for 2070 and 2205 over all i really like 1800 its a true successor to 1404 which has been the best game in the series up to this point hes never getting any i wish ca could be like this going back up after the failure that was the previous games unfortunately they always only go downhill never back up can confirm that the 3 star enemies are far more aggressive i tried it out and one of them declared war on me in the first 10 minutes of the game and blockaded my progress for about an hour before i broke out and signed a ceasefire with them at one point i nearly lost my main port because the 3 star ai sent a massive fleet to conquer me and my fleet was too far away to help out i was constantly building new port guns to just try keep them at bay to buy time until my fleet arrived they arrived just in the nick of time to sink the ai fleet great vid btw 114 wtf what does it matter freedom hating arseholes it sure intrigued me when a game focused on keeping a population happy so it can be exploited has uplay drm have a question are roads only in straight lines or can you have curve roads also thanks i absolutely adored it as well i dont know how many closed beta keys they gave away so i dont know how lucky i was to get to play it but i absolutely loved the game somehow manages to blend the immersion and depth of anno 1404 with the straightforwardness of anno 2205all the while looking stunning hahaha im the exact same never played any of the anno games and saw it getting buzz on youtubetwitch started to play it and absolutely loved it and and now not sure how to last 2 months until its released great video as alwaysand you are right about aiits a little bit too passivebut all the rest is masterpicegame is so amazing for someone who played their first anno game you sir did some research and properly played the game kudos for that i played a lot of anno 1404 didnt really enjoy two last ones i cant wait for 1800 i played most of the anno games its my favorite economic sim their last game sucked but i can tell they are back on track with this one however i still wont buy itbecause i dont have the time to play it anno games are a huge time sink come for the review stay for the schlong excellent is right hans off my schlong and awesome a review of an awesome game by one of my favorite reviewers ive been waiting on this for ages played every single anno game to death please dont suck ass you really should do a complete build along and show every thing shit load of boats what the hell i think the captains from all the ships that they saying wtf you lost all your timber cause you set it to sell everything or rather to keep it at a balance of 0 d also the trade union you built does absolutely nothing since there are no farmsclaypits in its influence radius finally bridges are built by simply drawing a road over the river since warehouses make their wares available to every other warehouse you could also forgo building a bridge and simply put a warehouse next to the claypit so still cant get it if logistic in this game is a thing its nice seeing you testing other games than total war id rather have you call it buttwater damn cant wait for next part you can build a normal wooden bridge using the road build icon on top of the water crossing hey surreal this is fantastic a game right up your alley loved the new video from the new chief purveyor of schnitzel and sons house and other wares one more thing you can play this game in a first person mode press ctrlshiftr near town where lots of houses are present and building a bridge is just finding the right crossing point when road building like so hell see it fellow guardsmenwomen that evil uncle sounds exactly like saltzpyre from vermintide somewhere out there el president is smoking a cigar ah when my britania ruled 13 of the world what happend to those days british empire 16001960 728 it seems our commissar has delved too deep into the wrong side of the anime ive recently found this game i know ive been under a rock ive been watching raptor but most favourite youtuber has started playing it please carry this playthrough on nice this is a great game but you need to a ton of more timber and bricks believe me youll need them so i suggest you to focus on that first and then make weapons they sell like hotcakes and check the range of that fire station i think the fire in the farmer district is out of range hey why did you delete the ac 3 series from your channel also do a face reveal best city builder in a decade its so good its unbelievable love this game series tropico with less presidente it must be something german about you schnitzel sons the right pronounciation of schnapsmakes me very happy herr kommissar straight out of ditchwater i recently got around 15k population i dont know how you keep up with everything when you get to that point old world new world multiple islands riots war social class advancement like what the fuck lol i couldnt keep up with everything so i just went to war and killed the ally to end it one important tip you missed you can directly control the productivity of building types by 50 to 50 affecting happiness how is this useful the bread production chain for example uses 2 farms 1 mill 2 bakeries for a perfect ratio since 1 bakery can feed 1100 workers 2 is usually overkill on small islands where you cant fit that many people or buildings so you can reduce the productivity of the mill to 50 to get a 111 ratio and get a happiness bonus at the same time you can also use this to not overproduce a raw material the beer production ratio is 2 farms 1 malt 3 hops 2 breweries with 1 brewery enough for 1300 workers you can reduce that to 1 farm 2 hops and 1 brewery by reducing the malt and hop productivity and at the same time increase happiness hey i was wondering if u have any pointers on how to earn more money in at the balance of 200 and cant get it positive hah very good idea but what if you need to do a quest that requires pork not the finished product really helpful this killed off the exact stuff i was trying to find on the wiki and other longer videos i wish more people would do short punchy guides to games like this id rather look at a list of 30 videos on individual subjects exactly the ones i want than a 30 minute video covering it all how to you change location of delivery like can i make the wood go directly to cutter instead trough storage i see the yellow line but can it be changed can you make longer guide videos this seemed too short and not in depth enough but i appreciate you making these videos good idea on the closed loop roads that might be difficult in the new world islands as most are cut up by river ways beta was fun really thx for this will there be cars sl1pg8r what happened to all of your modded ark series the only playlist you have is 33 episodes and i cant find them anywhere did you take them down because i have been binge watching your older ark series and you did so many modded playthroughs i hope you repost them please do i tried going to a place called rumjob island but i read the sign wrong all i could think was demonetized thought the title said something else lol really miss your ark videos i cant wait till you get steam stuff n things sugarcane is a pain in the butt because it is 1 hot 2 cane snakes one of your ships has a crew thats ill they are spreading illness from island to island also could i see you use the shipisland trade interface just once so i know you know its there when a ship is in range of an island click the icon in the upperleft of the ship panel a box with rightarrow and leftarrow under it this episode was amusing watching to see how long it would be before sl1p notices the island cant produce cane love ya sl1p the amount of love you have for this game makes it that much better 3 keep on keeping on ma man much love and appreciation for all you do on a sl1pscale of 1 to 10 ill have to give this an 1800 nice one cool title btw u can press shift to make all blueprint building at once of the same building great video as always also thanks for reminding me how much i miss bdubs anyone else read rimjob in the cover picture no just me that was a double take title for sure that title made me do a double take for sure thought thats a demonitized if i ever saw one lol good one i cant find this game on steam ive only been able to find the other anno games but not this one run island stuff and things run keep it up i prefer ark please do more modded first view boy esse jogoparece dawn of discovery top rip satsfactory which episode is he doing the trading route ive been waiting for ever its not fun anymore but cant switch to other playthrough to learn from it raptor meme i dont always set up trade routesbut when i say i will i wont do it anyway i really love this game right now the only thing is that the campaign was really short does anybody know if they plan to release more campaign content in the future what be a decent pc for this game any links to some a satisfyingly productive episode take out george take out george can you set up a trade route just to show us welcome to the new communist world where every section of a production is seperated says he will upgrade the roads in the city upgrades every road but the ones in the city hmmmm call the new island rextoria everytime when u get into a war or a fight the epidsode is over its so sad want to see some action but anyway keep up that good work read description i need to watch this whole series this game is kicking my butt you dont have to thank us for watching your vids we watch it cause your awesome but ifif you do want to thank ushow bout you finally do those trade routes xd trades wait for it routes seriously do trades routes dude alright some improvement over time nice one 1 advice try capture the island belonged to george near between the main island and the current mini island you settled and you will have the control of the sea between 3 island from the south and place 3 fleet protecting the pathway among the three island much easier to contain just make sure to make peace with the anne harlow pirates constantly or ceasefire yes go to war and dont forget to divide ur navy into 2 fleets name the new island batuu in star wars canon batuu is described as a remote frontier outpost and old trading port just a thought also enjoying the vids keep em coming still the right angle roads goddamn some of the production chains in this game are just stupid why the hell would you need windows to build mines and quarries ive never seen a mine with windows the last i seen is that they are underground it makes no sense and the whole production chain just to build glasses i wont even go there the one thing this game hasnt got which would be necessary for all the production chains is tools all these workers must build everything with their bare hands make bloody trade routes war is coming seems to me george i say go for the jugular and see if he wants to make peace after you conquer his island nothing like eating humble pie war is declared what i do kill them all except carl he is good george and the warmonger daughter of a should die theres no other way than with a full scale naval invasion raptoria why doesnt he just buy the island he could sell some of those ships that he can make for practically nothing and buy one of the smaller islands that he has majority share ownership of and it would solve his resource shortage practically immediately full out war on his second strongest place then wait for a battleship or two to attack main take the island tip you can add extra destinations to trade routes to avoid enemy areas also name suggestion for mining island industria jesus raptor make reliable trade routes you seem to be out of many resources and you cannot micro manage everything you should set up trade routes that is how the npcs are getting the upper hand on you i saw 2 ships of the line take out 1 battle shipif that helps any the fleet needs replaced 12k is a noble death you should max out the roads in the industrial district kill mrsmith it is cool to watch your video too raptor it is cool to watch your video too raptor full scale invasion war is the only option zinc helps collagen stop pimples therefore the tiny plot of land could be pimple island or zit for short the new island should be called port raptor no war get steam ships first then you should go to war waar waaaar waaar george must end but u r gonna need about 15 of large ships and 23 cruises u must finish him he wants the war and i am expecting that the next episode or the following to it karl will declare war on u so u must be fast dude your people are unhappy and make trade routes i love this show its even better than jurrasic park we want wars blocades on george and warmonger and more of the raptorian navy also have this ship name idea obliterator raptor you should not go to war george has more defenses like big bettys and cannon towers and etc with great offense with battle crusiers like carl so going to war is an excuse what i am about to say unresposible and unstretigic choice you should try to make a peace treaty or ceasefireand while that happens you can try to improve on both offensive and defensive forces so sorry if this is so long plus like andor reply so raptor can see d invade now use profits to build up conserve your strength and protect your resources for the time being once your navy is empowered by new technology though crush your enemies without even a hint of mercy i love both of your series 1 you should build a repairing crane and ship yard on the shore of port dino island to keep the siege efficient 2 i can recommend more canons on all shore lines of your island 3 try to organize your docks better build into the water youll save so much space that way 4 maybe another power plant on the main island docks 5 name for the battle cruiser mermaids desire 6 name for the new island the back yard raptorias back yard anyway i cant wait for all the nonsense to end so you could really start beautify the city ill keep watching the videos and support you really love your content keep it up youre a cool guy raptor but you should really try to focus on stuff that actually makes you progress step by step instead of war and building the videos are becoming 90 checking on stuff and doing minor things all over the place make it easier for yourself set up traderoutes focus on one thing and store the other ships in a place without checking and repositioning them too regularly im sorry but its going from super fun to frustrating to watch call the mineral island heavy metal land ships in the group will have same speed dont stop until you have an empire invade name for the new island narc island because its your supplier new raptoria cupboard island you should ally with carl and genocide maggie george will fall in line once he runs out of trading partners with this structure you can receive a lot of ships that will be picking up and dropping off your goods there is in the build menu another structure that allows you to receive more ships read description pro tip you dont have to waste your influence with minor propaganda bonuses small island named gilligan island name mineralsota try peace for now build more defence then hit him and send george down the mines that would be cool brilliant episodes raptor im really enjoying this i am so hyped for the next vid about the war i would try to make an alliance with carl wait for at least 1 steel warship and then first take out his i dont know his name so i just call him my dad died dont build mines small cities and when he no more is that powerful attack him hopefully with carl together but you play so you decide what to do thats just an idea ps how always awesome video ps ps xd read description fullscale invasion destroy him elemintate the threat war war and more war its kind of funny youre going to war because a old man cant move on or grow up might need few more ships for war war always war peace is for the weak d if it is war they want it is war they will get finish him off great to see more of this war hit him right in the heart go for his main port my dude get him good this was the best intro ive ever heard hey raptor dont the traders sell white flags and things couldnt you protect your ships sailing from crucial items with those trade routes you are getting very very messy you must set them already and start taking out some competition we want more no wait i meant we want war and more anno 1800 episodes take his islands for yourselve coool lol every episode you say atleast 510 times that youre gonna fix traderouts but you could call the island raptoria jr you should invade and demolish georges two islands near your new island war fuck him up and then put him in a choal mine so he suffocates of all de dust in his lungs muhahahaahhaah can you name the different buildings like give them individual company names 3120 my proposal for name is el hierro like the one in the canary islands it means the iron hope you like it name the new island pollution paradise mate i know youre juggling three videos per day but youre so out of focus all over the place your videos last 50 minutes yet you do so little because of all the chaos you make jumping nonstop from island to island navy oldnew world and it wasnt always like that take a deep breath focus at one problem or two no biggie but not 10 at the time take a slower pace and your videos will be much more enjoyable this is all coming from the good place so hope you wont take offense build supply lines and go to war why do you keep saying your going to start trade routes yet every video you are doing it manually please just use trade routes and make fleets to protect the clippers and you can focus more on the islands and less on manual trade wait why are you manually sending coal you can do it automatically in the trade screen and you can even use the npcs ship to do it just another tip when checking supplies in a warehouse you can sort the types to make it easier to find what youre looking for consumer goods to see if people have all they want raw metarials for metal etc hi raptor big fan do more men of war you can use stone roads to increase the range of the power station too make sure its well connected to maximize range your my second favourite dino raptor made me buy this game im so addicted to it now finally another one its getting addictive yo are a cool youtube typically i tell a sponsor what i want to do and they say oh god no but hey anno let me do it every time i watch your videos i just think yea we would be great friends i have one thing to comment lmfao lets be honest if youre going to sponsor gary expect the extreme 153 its like the perfect representation of capitalist society everyones working to their own demise nailed it woman interrupts gray gray congrats family evolved into barbecue only in a game that gray plays can dude sell balloons while the mansion right above him is on fire 621 you should have named the hideous capital portauprince or detroit or evencamden new jersey infinity be like o 153 no thats communism the people destroyed the city destroyed killmead destroyed the houses destroyed the population destroyed the potato farmers destroyed everything destroyed you have been destroyed everybody this looks nice gray this looks flammable i love that for every city making game gray has 3 things in his vocabulary yeet kill me and hell anno 1800 the only sponsorship that allows you to say playing the game normally is boring elwlvosen something for the cokplesegonorr dm anno 1800 knows what the people want and what the people want is total destruction xd seriously though youre totally right the destruction animations and the mobs look amazing really awesome graphics and i appreciate the level of detail in both the buildings and the fires xd good stuff on the plus side the sick people get heat to stop the sickness who wishes that he named every city hell come on it cant be just me some people would say this looks beautiful i say it looks flammable wow gray as if you havent said anything like that fun fact theres actually a town in michigan called hell him and kevin should coop not gonna lie u realy made me wanna play this game you and your wife and burn down the island together its date night xd i was playing anno 1800 with this video playing in the background and i spent 3 minutes looking for the fire that broke out really wanna play this game now so i know what its like when gray isnt murdering everyone lol chaos is my mistress is an amazing line some people just love to watch the world burn good on anno to know their market the game and it calls anno people who knows spanish 340 pretty realistic just go to a highclass restaurant please play a game and not kill all the people chaos is my mistress gray 2019 the people were rioting because the city is being destroyed but they destroyed the city even more the only time you can see a riot and then a street over theres another riot and the next street over youve never been to portland have you 235 jokes on you gray i live next to hellmichigan hey look its detriot moral is the story if you plan on playing this game right add a freaking fire station this looks like such a cool game and its really neat of them to sponsor you wow anno 1800 thats a rly long game series how come i never heard of it why dont you make a potato farm island who wants to watch it this video makes me want to buy the game omg they are billions rioters gotta love that home improvement grunt lol putricity intellectual know as gray wtf is yeet what exactly are these people protesting the fires tf is that supposed to do i love how his entire channel is him just being chaotic evil this is my favorite type of channel play this game more you should do a co op with kevin i just imagine the developer that had to go to grey not knowing exactly who he was and hes just watching this like omg what is he doing why is he doing this while another developer is just like its fine he does this all the time then the other developer just staring at this as he realized what he did indie i feel this tag miiiiiight be a bit off citizen minding their business gray thats like a sin or something am i slowly going insane or is this actually the video when the mayor starts making threats on the first day on the job hes 100 gray id be playing anno 1800 if it wasnt a damn egs exclusive but human was terrible confusing each other kinda late replybut is this game also for ios devices death and destruction have never been such fun how do those houses look flammable gray there made out of bricks sponsor a video tells gray that he can do what he wants we get the perfect example of how it was when nero watched rome burn hashtag themoreyoulearn title i built a city designed to burn in hell anno 1800 me wat do i say o i just said somethin and again and again and again okay okay lets stop lmao the link doesnt work i tried downloading it and its not working maybe because i have a mac already got about 200h in this game i love it wait gray is floridian that explains a lot youre starting to concern by killing everyone in every game do you need to talk fun fact theres a place in norway called hell honestly if i made a game i would pay gray to play it just to see what monstrosity he can come up with if gray can do it most likely someone else will too plus it might help with working out the kinks the game might have just saying he would be a great tester working together is never better when it brings down an entire civilization every 5th century barbarian agrees screw tnt ttry and demo a torn via riots p hold on explosives are explosive i had no idea finnish but just need to say itnjet molotoff where the hell does he find these games lol overcrowded cities constantly on fire or rioting sounds like the 70s grey bringer of the apocalypse hispanics be like a why wtf i want to see gray and kevin destroy a city together whenever i watch videos on this channel is makes me wonder how many developers actually play or have people test play the game every unintended way the game can be played to really test the game i i also thought of this when someone was telling me about the stuff in the latest call of duty so much for the backstory of grim dawn i can see it here myself thank you for the heads up i wanted this game so now i bought it with the discount used uplay coins to get 20 on the 30 bucks ish and i just paid something around 26 euros the free trial was very fun to play gray ive been wanting this game for so long and it was your video that told me it was free for trial dope man is it wrong that i kind of want gray to run for president citizens our governor is burning our houses down what should we do also citizens fix it with more fire well they gotta be nice and toasty for the winter just wait not that toasty sir i said not that warm sir not that hot sir please no their burning i would really like to live in this place and take orders from a high mayor that just escaped from prison i think he should be president anno 1800 picked the perfect guy for an advertisement i heard the word dynamite and i was immediately interested damn imagine getting sponsored by the game that lost to fe3h sksksk the way you pronounced anno at the beginning seemed a bit like ano which means anus lmao 613 lmfoa literately my stomach hurts you can go into firstpersonviewjust to see everybody die interrupt me again and im setting your whole family on fire and thats why i subscribed months ago but all he did was build cities wrong and watch then commentate as things broke down 352 he accidentally said bitch new name for your world in any game killmepleasenotacting gray how do i best help these people me purge them in flames gray constantly kills everything also gray ill fuckin do it again fairly disappointing that gray didnt name his city yeetland otherwise another piece of wonderful and anarchic content fun fact about the anno series every title adds up to 9 1800 1602 1701 2070 1404 i dont think the devs have ever said why though been a fan of this series since it started how does that house look flammable some people would say that looks beautiful i would say that looks flammable is the one hour life game a perfect example of a socialist society i totaly forgot i had this game gray will you sponsor me any game sure what will you do with it gray kill everyone any game hell na gray will you sponsor me anno kill all sons of bitches thats my official instructions can you play an actual game pls grey suddenly becomes king of a region of land all subscribers nuclear sirens go off in their heads me oh great grey please have mercy on us god dammit gray this is how you lose sponsors lmao actually the best way to help a city is 2 take away the starbucks and replace it with a statue of scythe fingers holding a microphone what gray didnt know is that there is a city in michigan called hell michigan we are on trending the joy in grays voice these graphic screams 2008 sponsor hey ill sponsor your video do what you want gray hmm ubesoft sponcerd you hi how about you back to farming simulator 19 he forgot all of the above in the pole play people play ground i want to see gray try to fix one of his games after he

ladies and gentlemen let me introduce the gazebo nobody gray welcome to the onl gray this is the only time when youll see a riot across the street from a riot across the street from a riot hong kong are we a joke to you some people would say this looks beautiful i would say this looks flammable gray still 2019 alright so were checking out the only youtuber whos heart pumps napalm instead of blood its graystillplays play video dammit he needs some milk gray 2019 this game actually looks legitimately really really pretty though what the hell xd why am i only just hearing of it now your edits have become more beautifully sloppy and i love it not too over done but still in your face enough to know that gray definitely isnt messing around lmao was it just me or was hell burning again gray its fun watching chaos and destruction me grays a tyrant in worldbox replace the water with lava that shoud be interesting can you tell me a game which is similar to both age of empire and world box pleaseor in simple words combination of these two games anno 1800 so how many incidents and disasters do you want grey yes graywe all now that your only goal in games is suffering anyone else a big fan im gonna u to everyone that likes this and sus to me this is the gray im talk in about ano in spanish means anus it is a big shame that scummy company practices can make a game unpalatable i was thinking about buying it when they released but unstinting it from steam the way they did was so despicable reminded me once again not to touch anything i see the ubisoft name after rioter 1 lets burn everything down rioter 2 everything is already on fire rioter 1 it can be more on fire molotovs ensue fire and riots looks like france p this looks flammable graystillplays 2019 anno 1800 and control are my favourite games of this year all is fine all is well until gray sends you to an explosive hell burn it to the ground anybody else play his videos in the background as you go to sleep or am i psychotic can u play totally accurate battle simulator there was only one thing missing i would have liked to see a mob of police knocking heads of the rioters while they were burning the buildings then you would have come full circle is this game on sale again for steam im waiting to buy it until then graystillplays i have a challenge for you try and safe yeet and hell and make it a thriving capital your challengerestore order d there were some amazing gray quotes in this ngl this game is beautiful first person mode ctrl shift r enjoy this isnt even the first game where grey blew up an innocent island lol gray the t blew up first biffa nooooo gray i said t not tea how the hell are u making profits with this city this town feels like its the spiritual successor of ankhmorpork sponsor alright heres a game that allows you to create a town in the 1800s gray yeah were not doing that more exploding dynamite factories dammit figured this game would be free to play the same day transport fever 2 comes out now i want to play both at the same time and dont know what to do do whatever you want famous last words me a french and a intellectual this video felt just like home 656 im surprised you didnt comment on the woman projectile vomiting directly into the baby carriage shes pushing if i ever make a game im gonna give grey a copy and tell him to do anything he wont and try to break it if he cant break it then im 90 sure my game is unbreakable greys approach to civil engineering is much like the russian one was when building the chernobyl reactor bruh youre screwed on the news they basically just said that channels like you arent going to get paid you still have me as a viewer though the reason i subscribe to gray cause i want see more burn you know linus keeps telling me about this game but grey may have sold me on it my brothers and my dad plays this game now thats how you make a sponsored video its so rare to see someone play the game of an ad i wanna get this cuz of it god damnit omg love it please play more of this game gray we need a lets play just realised gray is the organic equivalent of the 3d mark graphics card test engine tbh i dont like spending money but this looks great dude you are hilarious your tone of voice sets the tone for everything you play the most interesting thing is that grays fan will legit try this game out just to screw up a multitude of lifeforms and if thats not beautiful i dont know what is gray i realized you sound like a perfect 1940s newscast dude a nuke has been dropped on the cities of hell and yeet killmead is on the retreat so lord regent love what youre doing with dunwall i cant remember how many times gray has used hell as the city name or the formation of his city he need some milk i cant more smoking rubble damn it and clouds of miasma from piles of rotting plague ridden corpses would you ever go back and make a funniest moments video or something like that people sponsoring gray so that he k demonetizes even more people seems legit gray you sick barsted anno we have made a terrible mistake grey well you did say to do what i wanted d d d and whats even more hilarious is that her family is actually fighting a fiend who is all about setting her family and friends on fire and then theres you subtle but im already subscribed maybe a little quieter on it and id make another way to sign in subscribe and watch i love what they did with the age of empires building blocks for the intricacies of the units ans the building style it looks like if civilization and age of empires had a kid and it was a sim city and you you sick beautiful man you managed to do both your city skyline style and the sims style shenanigans to be fair there isnt a scenario in grays lets plays that doesnt involve living in hell sounds like a simulation of enschede in the netherlands i think theres not one other video in which gray had so much fun and did the outro half laughing i am happy for you gray this was fun to watch because of you laughing and commenting of course anyone else get reminded of call me keven watching this mans vids dynamite is made of nitroglycerin not gunpowder i think its a good idea to get gray to play your games if he doesnt manage to break the game or make it lag then you know its good actually there is a town in norway called hell httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhq7auhtbnlclistplw8xxej0p21frqklda1ror0r8bdaxq4y4index1 im not spamming i need this you think im gone ehhh mwahahaha isnt this just present day america did anybody realise that gray said he wanted a person to help him burn the city quicker ailright im sorry but paul felony is already taken you can have xxpaulfelonyxx paulfelonythepro or paulfelony3 the one thing i learned from watching gray is that he shouldnt be god if he gets to control the world hell destroy it hey gray im working on a fan fiction and the main villain for it ispretty much you but a whole lot more powerful this game needs riot conflict and musket men theres nothing like having a romantic dinner with your wife right next to someone whose having a romantic dinner with their wife surrounded by everyone having romantic dinners with their wives xd gray who like most other millennials has never been to a restaurant 2019 oh my god this reminds me of paris he yeeted that civilization into hell nobody people who speaks spanish the name is what looks like modern day communist china gray chaos is my mistress me and the four horseman are your polygamous family they said do whatever you want i suppose they realized that you just have to let chaos reign try towns men yet quite easy to screw people up tbh play some city skylines or sims again also sorry i cant support my computer would turn to a black hole erase the universe and rebirth it the moment i pressed play there is no link to click on would really like to see you play little miss fortune i dont like your vote i chose erase it before it exists myees anno i would play you if you were on steam ya litlle shaites when he started talking about the dynamite factorys i thought he was gonna say something about them being lucrative or something then i remembered oh yeah this is graystillplays lol gray please play a game called getting over it lol please game devs do whatever you want gray this graystillplays chaos launch code accepted activating launch sequence 350 gray getting them swears in so coppa doesnt screw him over it warms my heart to hear gray enjoy himself this much setting everyone on fire shoulda names the town mixtape so its say fire mixtape okay ill go more of these please d townspeople no more fires how do we get our point across by setting the town on fire when he said capitalist he meant socialist working hard for the community only to be killed horribly socialismsucks gray names his town killmead well i name my town plz dont let gray inno ads how should we protest against our mayor that loves to set things on fire throw molotovs at buildings good idea you missed your chance to name your govenor florida man how do these houses look flammable gray2019 505 im getting hungry just thinking about what that burning butcher shop smells like this type of game and universe sandbox are my favorite the prisoner is a man from the holocaust and of course even though this is a completely different game spleens still got pregnant and florida man was sighted in his bath towel the game designers really wanted gray to play this because his game play shows off the detail of what happens when all chaos breaks loose not all players would show that off so well its not a gray video without molotov cocktails grey get rid of all sources that sims can make food as the sims will starve and become cannibals ubisoft is just like if they are having fun let em unless its multiplayer yeet and hell best cities ever xd this video this game is amazing i want it lol coppa cant strike gray because in the first ten seconds of every video he says dammit i havent watched the whole video and i know this is something better than the pompaii volcano i havent watched the whole video and i know this is something better than the pompaii volcano rip graystillplays jan 16 2016 jan 1 2020 was fined millions by the ftca over the damn coppa thing all im bringing is smallpox and hatred xd nobody not a goddamn soul gray interupt me again and ill set your entire family on fire theres no such thing as bad publicity ubisoft meanwhile in the datacore of steam game court judge so one of you are going to be played by the evil florida man it wont be easy anno oh sht angry mob our leader is burning down our town what will we do brilliant mob leader if we burn down the buildings first our leader cant burn other things down just hearing that the devs told gray that he could do whatever he wanted with this video makes me want to buy this game grey get any sandbox game new hell thumbnail dammit 55 off gray 40 off literally every human being that isnt gray that building looks nice gray that building looks flammable more of this kinda amazing how hard it is to lose this game lol 036 i fuging laughed so hard when you said 3 and again at 219 never tell gray to tell do what ever he wants if you let me get that game for free im going to make something i dont want to keep thats a fact why yes i will subscrib gray makes so many things hell that youd think hed be satan himself or atleast his right hand man the sims 4 bored them to death only gray could have people literally burning in hell in a colonizing game there are two types of developers who would sponsor gray to play their games developers who have no idea what gray does with games and developers who know exactly what gray does with games wonder which one this is hahaha glorious anarchy this is effective advertising more game companies more companies in general would be wise to sponsor you love your vids thank you for making them some people would say this looks beautiful i say it looks flammable lol i died interrupt me again and im setting your whole family on fire i died do whatever you want game is not selling on epic we need more exposure because the initial steam sales are not covering the cost of development i blame you grayfloridaman will have his own island now 047 wouldnt you do that anyway some would say this looks beautiful i would say it looks flammable your new channel subtitle 818 putricity putridity yeah sorry im that guy not a cell phone in sight just people enjoying life i will get this for free i know how to get stuff other people cant soooo i love how grays selling point on the limited offer is that we can kill as many people as you possibly can and ive never heard gray laugh so much i love gray hes one of the best xd burn baby chaos is my mistress go forth if i made a game this is the kind of commercial i would want for it ah so this is just australia great a gameplay on a nontext based indi game wooo this is the one time where im not mad at a game publisher dev paying someone to play there game can you do more minecraft and city skylines also sims interrupt me again and ill set you whole family on fire werent you going to do that anyway i built a city designed to burn in hell so los angeles so were checking out the only game that would sponsor me to blow up a city full of people did you know that there was someone who built an american tank out of budlight boxes and cans gray is my new reason why my bank account is empty interrupt me again and im setting your whole family on fire graystillplays 2019 you sound so happy which makes me happy 233 oh so theyre in michigan 154 its also a good description of most socialist societies except that no one is working i ment boy and this ah finally anno knows what we want to see all ads should be in this form by the way im a big the is my sisters tablet hey gray in sims 4 you should make every one suicidal and crazy and also put a lot of dangerous items to i love the vids gray builds tens of dynamite factories to start fires citizens pish posh applesauce well show you how its really done i did not know you could play this game at that level of absurdity i feel like im on of the few that caught the les miserables joke at the beginning 437 the person that did the audio right there sounds like morgan freeman grey i would say that this looks flammable me proper thinking ubisoft nope not getting my money i bet theyll put microtranactions into this game soon enough just you watch is this hell or london in september 1666 gray could you tell the developers of this game to add mass downgrade building i am so pissed and tired of downgrading each building whenever i try to optimize my city just please deadass gonna get this game just to create chaos well i know what im since finals are over everybody i you had one word to sum up you life what would it be gray hell this must be what god be seein from heaven 351 was that supposed to be uncensored watching the world burn with gray love your videos what about ostric usually if a youtuber makes a video completely sponsored i just ignore it but for you i make an exeption im entirely convinced that the end of world scenario thats bound to happen will just be gray getting the universes admin rights and doing what hes been doing to games unto us im honestly surprised that dynamite is highly flammable how unexpected gray you have truly outdone yourself when i think you have peaked you blast off into the outer milky way i love it keep on doing what you do gray keep on satan what the hell gray is this a new type of hell gray welcome satan you can stay here satan no thanks satan im the king of torture gray hold my beer a fire broke out in the poll at the beginning i misread riots as umm robots so good start person 1 hi how was your day person 2 flammable how was your day person 1 diseaseridden jeez gray you are crazy with power i guess i would be the same way if i was that excited saw the notification and the title was laughing before i opened youtube gray is the type of person that would nuke a city because he likes the way it looks gray casually explaining how youre supposed to play the game also gray were not doing that interrupt me again and ill set youre whole family on fire haha just kidding ill do it anyway did u try from dust would love to see it i love the new editing i bought this series from the first one 1602 i believe until they required uplay ubisoft got ahold of them so i cannot buy it its 2019 and uplay not only runs as administrator but stores data in the builtin admin account every time it gets hacked the attacker has admin over any computer running uplay since it runs as admin also great for ruining the admin account since it can literally write into protected locations now if i still ran 98se on a p3 i would not mind this but we have had file and directory permissions since the 90s ubisoft needs to hire some programmers from the last twenty years this is the most honest review of a game i ever seen so basically you get paid to murder innocent people i like your style hey gray could you try playing the oregon trail gray i want to burn the whole city down and cause riots anno 1800 you sick son of a bitch were in you know its a great game when they let gray demonstrate what could go wrong and actually sponser him to do whatever the hell chaos he wants play city skylines hes so chill about getting a sponsor you know im really starting to find my habit of crocheting while watching youtube videos to be quite funny i watch riots destroy buildings i watch dynamite factories explode and burn towns down to the ground all the while i crochet a lavender and white scarf for my little sister ps for your information im 13 school thought crochet was an important life skill and spent about two weeks teaching me crochet not gonna lie though it was pretty fun well its official gray is the more hype version of df anno 1800 knew what they were doing they knew the most bang for their buck was getting gray to giggle like a schoolgirl almost the entire time he plays their game i wonder if anno 1800 regrets sponsoring him gray makes town called yeet lazarbeam sound intensifies play rockmon company well pay you to advertise for us just tell your viewers this this and that grey sure but ill do it my way by burning everything to the ground and killing everyone after torturing them you know youre in florida when all your rooves set on fire nobody second e in yeet sounds of crashing and death me when im in a bad mood 048 one day i will be able to watch grays video as soon as it comes out one day lady interrupts gray dont interrupt me or i will put dynamite inside of your dog geez how many gazebos do you shemales need i love anno even though i did not expect to see this game on your channel its a welcomed surprise on april fools gray will probably just play the game he chooses normally gray i worry about you sometimes you can jump in at anytime in this video and quote anything he says and its amazing you should play soviet republic its a game where you run a city in a communist society no one gray interrupt me again and im setting youre whole family on fire i like how gray is still successfully building a city while there are disease outbreaks and explosions tbh i wanna buy anno now because of you this is very persuasive im very tempted im gonna do the free week just to see how it is thank you for sharing your disaster youre an inspiration 031 is it just me or does he look like he just escaped nazi concentration camp good luck with arsen grays approach to this game is my approach to fallout burn everything havent you let cities skylines have enough suffering do you have you ruin their past as well cool game id buy it if i had money glorious just brilliant this was funny 2x coz anno sounds like anus in spanish xd more dont feed the monkeys damm it infinitely imature gray today were making fireworks me yay i love firew gray human fireworks me oh the future is bright nothing like some good ol gray to relax before a band performance hey gray ever thought about being satans real estate agent do more of these plese so if i am in online co op and i get someone named gray ask me to destroy the world i will know its you d death and burning buildings so florida then anno 1800 is a great addition to the anno franchise highly recommend you check it out anno 2070 is still my favorite you know its a good game when gray is causing so much chaos that he is laughing so hard he cant even do commentary me at 030 looks over at ubisoft club characters also me realizes that ubisoft is crazy enough to sponsor graystillplays nobody anno 1800 you can build beautiful cities and gray burn them history british empire owned everything gray be like prison city to burn pickles mommy likes big big pickles in your face damn it this game is not on xbox one all it takes is 1 mad man a mad man by the name of gray to make a normal game into a awesome one with just 1 bad idea and lots an lots an lots of horrible devotions i appreciate the capitalism jokes lol paul felonykind of like jarvis but illegal gray the long dark goddammit hey grey by pressing ctrlshiftr you can switch into first person and walk through the flaming streets its a secret easter egg gray running for president gray i will get rid of our debt interviewer how do you plan to do that gray i will make murder legal and out law the fire department and police interviewer you said you could get rit of our debt gray there is no debt if your dead more murder god damnit can you get a single riot group to cross an entire island to destroy a single building boomers video games are violent gray i am the violence 1219 gray made a movie starring leonardo decapitated called gangs of killmead as the phrase goes some people want to watch the whole world burnand then theres greys shenanigans interupt me again and im setting her whole family on fire but grey her entire family detailed at length amounts to you her brother you just threatened to light yourself on fire if she interrupted you thats a dangerous game youre playing please continue kyle is famous i love it because it is so weird and crazy there is an ending where you turn into a lizard demon and a fat guy named frank sits on you until you turn back to normal remember eating the fridge well you can also eat gabby and then have a lightsaber battle with rachel its a beautiful day outside grays causing chaos fans are watching on days like this cities like you should be burning in hell can you dab in the next vr video wow a game where you can get the people to raze their own city you dont even have to do it yourself theyll do it for you ohhh i bought this game and barely played it now i know how to play it properly thanks bud not sure but i exprected much bigger and spectacular explosion from dynamitefireworks whatever it is xd this this is how you advertise successfully i want to see insurance toothpaste and depression medication adopt the same ad model no i will not download cake or orbit gum until i see at least three concussions and one anarchist on meth last time i was this early hell wasnt on fire brilliant gray by destroying countless gaming worlds you are making our world a better place you are the hero we needed im dying to watch you play gta gray is one of my favorite youtubers hes so funny they said i can do whatever i want code for gray is gonna murder people violently and viciously for his own enjoyment i am here for it 246 i love that the houses burning have a nice bacon symbol on top of them i just projectile vomited and it hit my dog wait youre building dynamite on a yeet i guess you could say you made a tnt yeeter morgan freeman a fire broke out he really sells this game where is the l iliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii newest made up word brought to you by gray putricity i built a city that burns in hell oh so you recreated florida then xd 028 well doh thats the prisoner of azkaban a fire broke outof the game it said it felt being used and taken advantage of xd molotov cocktails as if the city wasnt lit enough i truly wonder how many poor innocent souls were extraculated from their bodies in this video anno yeah sure just do whatever you want gray a peaceful life was never an option not on steam no thanks im ok gray for king president mcruler anarchy is good for the tow companies i would love to see a playthrough on this game that was a great advertisement gray if i would not already own the game i would try it ps dont forget to invest 100 ubi points to get 20 further discount you should have a settlement full of rich people and another one full of poor people and see what happens i changed all the school computers i could to law and order google backgrounds and it was awesome 901 for once i agree the mob rules hell is on fire not surprised i love your funny ass videos gray telling us about the game lady appears in the top right corner telling the player behind the screen what to do gray interrupt me again and ill set your house on fire ill use that threat starting from now on whenever someone interrupts me because my friends always talk over me when im trying to talk anybody else relate probably everyone does the t in yeet blew up the soonest well tea usually takes a lot less time to blow up on youtube but thats still acceptable literally turns into hell in record time too the human condition folks gray im not gonna lie i love it when the designer tells me to do whatever i want anno do what you like gray so you have chosen death more worldbox plz you mean paul felony the turd oh good a new game besides bit life etc games every game company we would like to sponsor your video so you can market our game gray i am gonna burn every house and kill every model on it game company ubisoft sounds good to me u should run for president lol whatever he wants those poor people anyone else want to see gray play and hopefully get sponsored by tropico 6 after watching this i built a place where everyone is happy gets what they want and lives forever things gray will never say rename your city yeetville yay im early pretty confident gray downs a sixer of natty lite before these videos this game actually seems fun imma check it out normal youtuber i built a total self fonctional city gray this actually convinced me to buy anno once i have money aka january gray you may not read this

laugh anymore but i swear every time i watch your vids they make me laugh like hell and i just wanted to say thank you for doing that and i cant wait for the next video id love to see gray change the poll for once where the most retarded answer is not at the bottom just to see how many people instantly click the lowest option i attack the gazebo gray love your videos you never fail to make my
